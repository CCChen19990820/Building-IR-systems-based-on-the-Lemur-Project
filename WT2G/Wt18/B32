<blockquote>
<font size=-1>

<p><b>God’s <font color="#ff0000">Love</font> We Deliver</b> recently published a <b>Technical Assistance Manual for Community-Based Nutrition Support for People Living with HIV and AIDS</b>, which is the end product of a study the agency conducted in 1994 among professionals in the AIDS field.

<p>The results of the survey demonstrated the need for a central source of information to address the many issues regarding HIV/AIDS and nutrition and the provision of related services.  The manual was designed and written with a three-fold purpose:</p>

<ul>
<li>To define community-based nutrition support (CBNS) by describing programs that provide for the food and nutrition needs of PLWA’s in the community at large, and by describing the activities that support these programs.
 
<li>To share vital information that will guide start-up agencies as well as help all of us who already provide CBNS to become better at what we do and to expand into new areas of service.
 
<li>To establish CBNS standards of care that are feasible, realistic, and adaptable to the needs of diverse communities.
</ul>

<p>The manual is a comprehensive guide -- the first of its kind -- that addresses how to create, sustain, and expand programs that provide people living with AIDS with practical, community-based nutrition services in the form of home-delivered meals, congregate meals, food pantry programs, and nutrition education and counseling.</p>

<p><b>The Technical Assistance Manual for Community-Based Nutrition Support for People Living with HIV and AIDS</b> is divided into three main sections: The Foundation, Community-Based Nutrition Support Programs, and Support Services.  Contained in these three sections are fourteen chapters covering the following areas:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B><p>

     Often when we "discover" something new and exciting, we think of it as new to the world,
     not just to ourselves. We may even consider it revolutionary in its importance. People who
     discover herbal therapy for the first time frequently have this reaction. In fact, the use of
     plants as medicines is as old as civilization itself. It is found in different cultures on every
     continent on this planet. the Egyptians sealed medicinal herbs with their mummified
     pharaohs to guarantee their health on their journey to the other world. In India, AYMEDIC
     medicine has been in constant use for thousands of years. The Chinese have books about
     medicinal herbs that predate the Christian calendar by 2,000 years. When the Europeans
     set sail to discover the New World, they carried with them their collection of herbal
     remedies. When they arrived here in America, they found the land populated by Native
     American nations, each with its own version of herbal treatments. Herbs and herbal
     treatments are mentioned frequently in both the Bible and the Koran.
<P>
     Before the development of modern medicine, herbal remedies were one type of treatment
     used by people around the globe. Similar discoveries were made about the healing
     properties of certain plants by cultures that had no contact with each other. For example,
     garlic was used by the Arabs, Babylonians, Chinese, Egyptians, Greeks, Hindus, and
     Romans to treat intestinal disorders, gas, worms, respiratory infections, skin diseases,
     wounds, scorpion and snake bites among other ills. Today garlic is being investigated for
     use against cryptosporidium. The oldest antiseptics were a combination of herbs and
     flowers used before their active ingredients were understood.
<P>
     Many ancient people believed that medicinal plants were effective because they protected
     people against witchcraft and the Evil Eye. A plant called wild angelica or the Holy Plant
     was cultivated because it was considered the best defense against witchcraft. Wolfsbane
     and garlic were used to keep vampires away.
<P>
     Even as we learn to separate superstition from the effective use of an herb, we must
     remember that our understanding or lack thereof will not help or hinder the effectiveness of
     a particular substance. Quinine made from cinchona tree bark was used by Native
     Americans to combat malaria long before the Spanish explorers arrived in South America.
     As recently as the 1980's, it was still used to fight malaria, especially the strains that
     have become resistant to the synthetic anti-malarial drugs. Probably the most famous
     example of a remedy being used effectively without understanding why was the British use
     of lime and lemons to prevent scurvy among their sailors during long sea voyages. It could
     be argued that this simple remedy was a major contribution to the British ability to
     dominate the world's oceans and set up its colonial empire.
<P>
     In the US today, very little investigation is being done to determine which herbs or herbal
     products are effective in the fight against infectious disease. There are thousands of herbs
     and herbal products on the market. In the absence of objective research, our task is to
     learn how to sort out the effective herbal medicines from the "witchcraft". In our society
     witchcraft goes by the name of profiteering. You can easily find an example of this
     witchcraft by looking through new age or holistic magazines in any health food store. The
     magazines are usually free. They exist by selling advertising space to manufacturers, just
     like any mainstream publication. The point of the advertising is simple: get people to buy
     the product. There is nothing holistic or new age about that. What is different is the types
     of code words used in these ads. Typical statements include ..."youthing," "reversing the
     aging process," "boosting the immune system." "Becoming centerrd or grounded, and
     "tonifying" certain organs, often the liver. The Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon began
     looking for the Fountain of Youth in 1513. He did not find it, so the search continues. My
     personal favorite is a vegetable preparation that is presented as "Brain and Body
     Superfuel, turbocharged with vitamins and minerals." For a moment I thought they were
     talking about steamed vegetables with rice and beans.
<P>
     If you want to use this ancient therapy to see if it can work for you, your first task is to
     educate yourself. Have realistic goals about what you want to learn so that you don't try to
     understand ayurvedic, Chinese, African and European herbalism in a month. It took
     thousands of years for these treatments to develop. You can't master them in a crash
     course. You might want to find a study group with people who have goals similar to your
     own. If one does not exist in your area, start one. All you need is one other person and
     you have a group.
<P>
     Beware of claims that sound too good. The claims will be good, the medication won't.
     Look out for code phrases like secrets of the Ming dynasty, elixir of the emperors, ancient
     cure unearthed and smuggled into the US. Conspiracy theories are very appealing
     because they trigger an excitement in our lives. They allow us to become part of the good
     guys searching for the truth. the bad guys are trying to keep us from finding it, and we can
     join in the crusade to defeat them. Bear in mind that if this "secret elixir" is found in
     10,000 health food stores from coast to coast, it is not much of a secret. On the other
     hand, if this magic bullet works it won't be hard to find countless people who have been
     cured. I am sure they will be happy to talk about their success. Unfortunately, most of the
     time the magic part is how fast the emperor's elixir increases the manufacturer's bank
     account.
<P>
     Try to find out about the area, culture or country that the particular therapy comes from.
     How is the health of the people there? Do they use the treatments that are credited to
     them? Where are their experts and practitioners trained? If an "expert" or practitioner is
     someone who read the literature wrapped around the medicine bottle 10 minutes before
     you did, you are in trouble.
<P>
     Don't be fooled by titles. An expert in one field is just as much of a layman as you are in
     another area that neither on of you has studied. Choose an area that has measurable
     success. The Chinese herbalists, for example, have a system worth looking into.
     Herbal.medicine in china today is no an alternative therapy, it is mainstream. A lot of
     research has been done on the immune system and specific herbal therapies. There is a
     great deal of information available and practitioners are trained well. Much of this
     information is available on the Internet.
<P>
     It would be a good idea if you could talk about your search with your health care provider.
     She/He may know more about herbalism than you think, or may be able to help you find a
     good practitioner. In any case, you should always tell you provider about all the
     medications of any type that you are taking. You may be embarrassed or uncomfortable
     about telling one practitioner that you are trying what you may think is a competing form
     of medicine. Don't be. If someone's feelings are hurt that is unfortunate and unpleasant,
     but what you are trying to avoid is an unhealthy or even dangerous combination of drugs,
     herbs and food. If you cannot speak openly with your practitioner, then you should think
     about finding a new one. Where your health is concerned you should leave no stone
     unturned.
<P>
     In order for any therapy to work effectively, the person using it must eat well. Both the
     quality and the quantity of the food must be at least adequate. There is a wide range of
     what constitutes good nutrition and each person must find a comfortable place in that
     range. But vegetables and whole grains must have a place. The Chinese placed brown rice
     at the center of their daily eating plan. Vegetables and other plants like seaweed were
     added next. Finally animal products were used to complete the picture.
<P>
     Many other Asian cultures also adopted this eating style. Here in the US, we seem to
     prefer eating in the opposite direction, even though we know the value of eating brown rice
     and other whole grains and vegetables. The American Cancer Society encourages us to
     eat less meat, reduce fat intake, and eat more vegetables. The USDA food pyramid also
     reflects this way of eating. Unfortunately, we don't see this way of eating as a form of
     herbal therapy. We still think of eating as separate from any kind of medicine. We can
     recognize the special healing properties of plants when we call them herbs, but not when
     we call them vegetables and grains.
<P>
     Eating well is as important as any form of medicine. Here is an example of the long-range
     consequences of an inadequate diet. I will use calories as an example, since most people
     understand the need for calories very well. If you need 2500 calories every day to fight the
     good fight against your illness and you get only 90% or 2250 calories each day, than
     every 10 days you have lost the equivalent of one whole day of eating (10 x 250 = 2500). If
     you continue eating at 90% of your needs for one month, you will lose 3 days worth of
     calories. After one year of this regimen, it is as though you haven't eaten for 36 days,
     more than 5 weeks. This means the lose of 5 weeks worth of energy, vitamins, minerals,
     phytochemical, protein and fiber. Where is you body getting the nutrients it needs to
     continue its work of living and fighting off infection? It is actually consuming itself. The
     process that is going on is a form of slow starvation. The less you eat the faster the
     decline. The potential damage to your immune system from this loss cannot be made up
     by any medication from the east or west.
<P>
     Do not fall into the trap of thinking that medicine, supplements, or meal substitutes can
     take the place of real food. Whatever type of medicine you decide to use, make sure you
     put it into a body that is well nourished. Remember, eat your vegetables every day.</B>

<title>NATAP: 141W94 Double Protease Inhibitor Study</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="arial, helvetica" size=-1>

<a href="index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3 align=center>141W94 Double Protease Inhibitor Study and Brief Protease Therapy Discussion</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>January 11, 1997</p>

<p>Today, Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced the start of a double-protease study combining 141W94 (protease inhibitor licensed to Glaxo Wellcome for development from Vertex). This is an important event for HIV treatment because of the potential for potent therapy using double protease regimens. In addition, pre-clinical in vitro data from Glaxo indicated that saquinavir may reverse 141W94 resistance and possibly be a promising combination.</p>

<p>48 HIV+ individuals will enroll in 24-week open-label phase II trial designed to test tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antiviral efficacy of 3 double-protease regimens: 141W94 plus either saquinavir, indinavir or nelfinavir. A 4th treatment group will use 141W94 + AZT/3TC as a comparison group. Entry criteria include above 200 CD4 and above 20,000 copies/ml viral load.</p>

<p>In 1997, a number of other double protease inhibitor studies will begin. This author, Jules Levin of NATAP, lobbied for protease-protease studies two years ago, but the research was delayed except for the saquinavir/ritonavir study. Unfortunately, research proceeds very slowly and at the dictate of the drug companies. My hope is that protease-protease containing regimens may be potent enough to suppress resistance that may have developed to a particular protease inhibitor. Many individuals are very discouraged because they've developed resistance already to a protease inhibitor. I think there is hope that a potent double protease regimen could address their needs. </p>

<p>Another important focus of research is to improve the dosing regimens of available drugs. Manufacturers will be trying to improve to bid dosing or possibly once a day dosing. DMP-266, the NNRTI from DuPont Merck promises to be once a day dosing.</p>

<p>One 4-drug study has already begun--ritonavir/saquinavir +AZT/3TC--and another should start soon if it hasn't already begun--141W94/1592U89/AZT/3TC. I expect that soon other 4-drug studies will begin. Four drug combinations are already in clinical use. Ritonavir/saquinavir with AZT/3TC or d4T/3TC are popular regimens. A main concern is the tolerability and compliance for such potent and complicated regimens.</p>

<p>We now know that initiation of a potent therapy should include at least two new drugs that have never before been used by the individual. Studies indicate that this is the best way to delay resistance, achieve maximal suppression of viral production and to prolong durability. Individuals are advised to be careful in selecting a regimen and in planning for future treatment. Proper strategies should be planned. In the past, we would add one new drug and its benefits would not last very long. In order to take maximal advantage of todays new more potent therapies, they should be properly used. Don't waste these opportunities. </p>

<title>NATAP: Access programs to viral load testing from Chiron &amp; Roche</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="arial, helvetica" size=-1>

<a href="index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3 align=center>ACCESS PROGRAMS TO VIRAL LOAD TESTING FROM CHIRON AND ROCHE</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Both Roche Diagnostics and Chiron Corporation have established Patient Assistance Programs (P.A.P) for individuals who are unable to access insurance reimbursement for the tests through other means.</p>

<p>The Roche PCR test was approved by the FDA in the Summer of 1996 and the Chiron bDNA test is currently being reviewed for approval by the FDA. Roche's test can measure viral load to a lower level of detectability of 400 copies/ml. Chiron's 1st generation test measures only down to 10,000 copies/ml; but, their 2nd generation test measures down to 500 copies/ml. The FDA is reviewing approval for both the 1st and 2nd generation tests. For more information about viral load testing--its use and limitations-- you can read on NATAP's web site -- <a href="initiate.html">Perspectives On Viral Load and When to Initiate Therapy</a>. This 20-page document is also available in a printed booklet published by NATAP. Included are the International AIDS Society's interim guidelines for using the test and interpreting its results. If you want a printed copy of this booklet contact NATAP through by e-mail (<a href="mailto:julev@aol.com">JuLev@aol.com</a>) or you can call us at 212 219-0106. </p>

<p>These two viral load access programs are meant to make viral load testing available to those who cannot afford it or do not have insurance coverage for the testing. </p>

<p>At this moment the Chiron program is available only in San Francisco and will be made available through the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Eligibility for free testing is supposed to be determined by Department Of Public Health criteria. There are 8 locations (see below for list) within San Francisco, where you can go for testing. You must call first for an appointment. Chiron has said they are in the process of arranging similar programs in other cities: Boston, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Houston, Miami.</p>

<p>For information about the Chiron test program and San Francisco locations, you can call toll-free <b>1-888-HIV-LOAD</b>. </p>

<p>Beginning January 1, 1997, the Roche Patient Assistance Program was started. Roche is offering a total of 50,000 free tests during 1997 to qualified individuals, regardless of where you live. If you have not received baseline viral load testing, you can receive two free baselines tests through this program. If qualified, these individuals will be offered three additional free tests during the course of the next year. Others will be permitted up to three tests during the course of the year. </p>

<p>For information about the Roche PCR test program, you can call toll-free <b>1-888-TEST-PCR</b>.</p>

<p>You can call this the Roche 888 number to start the enrollment process; an application form will have to be submitted. Application forms are supposed to be available at your doctor's office, or you can request it be sent directly to you. The patient's eligibility will be reviewed over the phone and an application is promised to be mailed within 24 hours to the physician. Roche says upon receipt of the completed application, determination of eligibility can usually be made within 24 hours. Both the patient and doctor will receive a letter of approval and a voucher for a free test. When desiring the next test, the patient will have to re-apply for qualification. The qualification review process will assist in determining if a patient has alternative reimbursement; and, will be directed to them.</p>

<p>If you are in San Francisco and are interested in participating in the Chiron program, you can call the following sites directly to make a test appointment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Haight Ashbury Free Clinic 487-5632
<li>Lyon-Martin Women's Health Services 565-7667
<li>Mission Neighborhood Health Center 552-3870
<li>South of Market Health Center 626-2951
<li>Castro-Mission Health Center 487-7500
<li>Maxine Hall Health Center 291-1300
<li>Tom Waddell Health Center 554-2940
<li>Ward 86 at SF General Hospital 476-0828
</ul>

<p>Two other important NATAP published booklets that are available: </p>

<ul>
<li>"Protease Inhibitor Users Guide"-- a 30-page compliance manual: side effects, drug interactions, dosing, storage, viral load monitoring, etc.
<p>
<li>"HIV Protease Inhibitor Report 3rd edition"--a 50-page up-to-date compilation of data for 5 protease inhibitors; mutation/resistance charts for each protease inhibitor, side effects, efficacy data.
</ul>

<h3>AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Meeting of December 1996 in
Washington, D.C.--Summary of Proceedings</h3>

<p><b>Reported by Jules Levin</b>

<p>There was considerable discussion of the current state of knowledge
regarding virus activity in
"compartments" other than peripheral blood, such as in semen, CSF, the
brain, lymph tissue,
etc; and, where research may be headed in trying to better understand their
relationship to
potent antiretroviral therapy.  Following is a discussion of some of the
proceedings at the ACTG
meeting, including the status of ACTG studies both ongoing or in development.

<p><b>ACTG 320.</b> Scott Hammer reported 1100 enrolled in study;
accrual has slowed and some
patients have withdrawn; the total enrollment goal of 1700 is overpowered
and he expects to be
able to enroll 1400 by reaching out for international enrollment.

<p><b>ACTG 355, START Protocol-Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral
Therapy Trial.</b>
Michael Saag is the PI and leading the way in trying to implement this
trial concept, although it
is meeting a series of obstacles.

<p>In its current formulation, it is a phase III comparative, open-label
factorial design study of
antiretroviral naive subjects with CD4 counts &gt;100 and plasma RNA >
10,000. However,
changes in protocol may still occur, as revisionist discussions are
actively ongoing.

<p>2,000 study participants would be randomized to one of two treatment
strategies and within
each treatment strategy to one of two utilizations of protease inhibitors
(immediate vs delayed).

<p>Strategy A --"Loose Control"- less aggressive RNA load control (HIV RNA
&lt;5,000) and
immediate vs delayed protease inhibitor (PI) therapy.


<p>Vs Strategy B-- "Tight Control"- aggressive RNA load control (HIV RNA ,&lt;
200) and delayed vs
immediate PI therapy.

<blockquote>
<p><b>REGIMENS</b>


<p>Strategy A: "Loose Control" Group (target RNA &lt;5,000)


<p>Arm A1: Loose Control/delayed PI Group<br>
Arm A2: Loose Control/immediate PI Group


<p>Strategy B: "Tight Control" (target viral load &lt;200)


<p>Arm B1: Tight Control/delayed PI Group<br>
Arm B2: Tight Control/immediate PI Group
</blockquote>

<p>The primary objectives are "to determine the necessity of suppressing
plasma HIV RNA to
undetectable levels (&lt;200) vs less aggressive intervention (maintaining RNA
&lt;5,000) and to
determine if less aggressive therapy will yield equally positive clinical
outcomes with less
toxicity and costs, with comparable resistance development; and, to
determine if there are any
differences in outcome within each approach based on timing of use of PIs
(early vs delayed)".
Arms A1 and B1 (delayed PI regimens) would be initially offered 1 of 6
different regimens.
Whether participants could choose or would be randomized is now open to
discussion. Saag's
protocol calls for patient choice; arms A1 and B1 (delayed PI) : AZT/3TC,
AZT/3TC/NVP,
ddI/d4T, d4T/3TC, AZT/ddI/NVP, or AZT/1592. After failure, patients would
move to the next
round which would consist of one of two different regimens; the next round
would also consist of
a variety of mostly non-protease 3-drug regimens; the final round would
consist of PI-
containing regimens.


<p>Arms A2 and B2 (immediate PI regimens) would consist of 7 regimens all
of which contain one
of four PIs: SQV, IDV, NFV, or RTN--SQV/AZT/3TC, SQV/ddI/d4T, IDV/AZT/3TC,
IDV/ddI/d4T,
RTN/AZT/3TC, RTN/ddI/d4T. Following would be three potential rounds of
regimen changes (all
3-drug regimens) which culminates in regimens containing two PIs.


<p>There is much controversy surrounding this protocol, bringing into
question whether or not it
will get started anytime soon or at all. At the ACTG Executive Committee
meeting, many
objections were raised to particular protocol points; but, at the end of
the session when
Principal Investigators were polled, all were in favor of this concept.


<p><b>ACTG 347.</b> Phase II study of 141W94 monotherapy vs
141W94 plus AZT/3TC. 84 study
participants (CD4 &gt;50-- RNA 5,000-50,000) randomized, double-blinded, and
stratified by
naive vs experienced. 1200 mg bid  of 141 plus 300 mg bid AZT will be used.
Purpose is to look
at safety, tolerability and perhaps most importantly, the potential for 141
as a mono-therapy
treatment.

<p>141W94 has been said to be in vitro more potent than other available
protease inhibitors, thus
its potential use as monotherapy. This may be the only opportunity to
examine its potential as
monotherapy over the course of this 6-month study. Tight cross-over
controls have been
promised by investigators for the protection of study participants--Roy
Gulick and Robert
Murphy. Any participant rising above level of detection of RNA assay will
be offered triple
therapy including 141.

<p><b>ACTU Site Performance. </b>At the Executive Committee
meeting, a number of points were
discussed regarding the performance of sites. 16/30 sites had at least one
deficiency; one site
had 3 deficiencies and 14 sites were slow in reporting a/e; the expected
standard for reporting
a/e is 100&#37; in one week. Regarding study accrual, 13 sites were below mean.
Strict monitoring
of performance will be enforced and some of the criteria considered will
be: speed of data
reporting, error rate, diversity of protocols implemented, work of junior
investigators,
number of junior investigators.  Four sites were singled out for top
scientific work: Harvard,
Johns Hopkins, UCSF, Northwestern. Sites were singled out for high
performance in accrual:
UCSF, Puerto Rico, Colorado, Penn, Seattle, Texas-Galveston.  Increased
efficiencies are needed;
for example, sites having an immunology lab should be doing immunology
studies. Tom Merigan
said that the ACTG moves too slowly in implementing studies. This message
was repeatedly heard
by me throughout the ACTG meeting.


<p><b>Plasma RNA. </b>The ACTG and the FDA are discussing and
examining more progressive ways to
use RNA in studies. Some would say this process is moving too slowly, while
others would say
adequate progress is being made. Scott Hammer gave a wide-ranging talk of
the pluses and
minuses of using RNA as a study endpoint. He concluded we need to further
assess data from
completed and ongoing studies, but that we were headed towards more
progressive uses of plasma
RNA. There were a number of presentations about using RNA in different ways
as markers in
studies; some of the different ways could be: actual decreases, proportion
below level of
detection, time to failure, AUC of RNA change minus baseline; another
analysis of 175 was
presented, which indicated that CD4 &#37; was a useful marker.


<p><b>IL-2. </b>Joseph Kovacs, of the NIH, presented a
discussion on the data and information to-date
regarding IL-2 therapy, current plans and the needs for future planning. He
presented the
recently published results of an intermittent IV IL-2 study. This
controlled, randomized study
examined individuals with mean CD4 of about 425 and RNA of 40,000.
Thirty-one individuals
received IL-2 and 29 were in control group; approved nucleosides were
utilized and the starting
regimen of IL-2 was 18 million units per day continuously infused for 5
days intermittently.

<p>After 10 months of study CD4 peaked at about 1000 CD4. All were offered
IL-2 and were
followed for at least another four months. During the course of the study,
doses were lowered
and regimens were individualized for tolerability and maintenance if CD4
increases. There were
no sustained rises in viral load when antiretroviral therapy was used,
although drugs of
moderate benefit were all that was available. Study indicated adverse
events and toxicities could
be better managed by individualizing IL-2 regimens. The length of dosing
cycles were in some
instances able to be shortened from 5 days to 3 days and that lessened side
effects while
maintaining CD4 increases. Lesser frequency of cycles of drug still allowed for maintenance of
CD4 increases.


<p>There were 5 AIDS-defining events in the control group--1 in the first
14 months and 4
subsequent; there were 2 in the group originally randomized to IL-2 during
the first 14 months
and 1 subsequent. Kovacs said, some patients have been safely receiving
IL-2 for 5 years in NIH
open studies and still maintaining CD4 increases.


<p>A randomized study, of individuals with higher CD4, was conducted
comparing sub-cutaneous
IL-2 of 7.5 million units twice per day vs a lower dose of 1.5 million
units twice per day, both
intermittent dosing. Although, dosing was either every month or every other
month, no
difference was detected between these two methods. Over the course of
6-month study period
there was a slight CD4 increase in the lower dose regimen; those using 7.5
million dose
experienced a 95&#37; increase in CD4 above baseline at 6 months; 80-90&#37; have
experienced a
50&#37; or greater increase in CD4; sub-cutaneous administration is associated
with lower
toxicities.

<p>An important study conducted by Judy Falloon, of the NIH, examined 10
individuals with CD4
about 100 or lower (9/10 had CD4 below 100) receiving IL-2 therapy and potent
antiretroviral therapy. Indinavir and accompanying nucleosides were
permitted to be used in
this loosely controlled study. After 12 months of study, Falloon reported
7/10 participants had
sustained significant rises in CD4. By my observations of the data, the
individual CD4 increases
experienced are at least suggestive that IL-2 can be effective in raising
CD4 for individuals
concurrently using IL-2 with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy).
Kovacs, Falloon,
Cliff Lane and others have concluded similarly because ACTG 328 will
examine individuals with
CD4 50-300 receiving either intermittent IV IL-2 or intermittent
sub-cutaneous 7.5 million
units per day with HAART. This phase II  study is intended to address the
aforementioned question
of whether or not IL-2 can be effective in raising CD4 when used along with
HAART, in a lower
CD4 population.

<p>Kovacs said, " for patients with early disease, we feel we have a safe
and well-tolerated
effective regimen. The big question needed to be answered is the clinical
benefit of IL-2. For
advanced disease....the Falloon data suggest efficacy."  Kovacs suggested
following a result of
positive data from ACTG 328, a study of clinical benefit in this population
should be conducted.
In the plenary session as well as in the committee meeting of the IBT/RAC
(Immune-based
Therapy/Research Agenda Comm), I expressed strong support for moving along
quickly to
implement studies of clinical efficacy. It was reported by the NIH, at this
committee meeting,
that they are trying to put together the backing for such a study, which
would be costly.
Discussions are ongoing with international groups expressing desire to
participate in study.

<p>However, it will be difficult to implement this study. Normally the
manufacturer of a drug
financially supports such a study. In this case, it appears as though
Chiron is not willing to lend
full financial support to such a study. Alternative financing will be very
difficult and time
consuming to arrange.

<p>Finally, Kovacs briefly addressed the question of functionality of the
CD4 cells induced by IL-2
therapy. He suggested, as well as Cliff Lane has suggested, there is no
data suggesting that these
CD4 are not functional.  He characterized the CD4 as "a polyclonal increase
in both naive and
memory phenotype cells.....In patients who have lost the ability to respond
to recall antigens
such as tetanus toxoid, IL-2 therapy does not restore that response; but,
if you immunize those
patients with tetanus toxoid, you are in fact able to induce an immune
response...In fact, the CD4
cells in these patients are functional and are able to mount an appropriate
response to challenge
with tetanus toxoid following immunization....The only way to determine
whether or not the CD4
cells induced by IL-2 are truly functional at the clinical level (able to prevent the development
of opportunistic infections and malignancies--that's the bottom line of how
we want to measure
the functionality of these cells) is through a randomized phase III trial
of clinical endpoints. We
don't have surrogate markers, at this point, which will tell us if these
CD4 increases will
prevent OIs".

<p><b>Commentary:</b>As you all know many individuals are at
home experimenting with the use of
IL-2 obtained from their personal physicians; as well, many of us are
desperate to know if IL-2
therapy can in fact have clinical benefit for advanced disease when used
along with HAART; I fall
into the latter category. It is imperative that we quickly launch studies
to explore the clinical
benefit of IL-2 in both less advanced and more advanced disease
populations. Otherwise, we may
never be able to truly assess this therapy. Studies of both groups should
be implemented
approximately at the same time. As well, a well-designed clinical-oriented
study in the
advanced population could yield results relatively quickly as compared to
the study in a less
advanced population, which could make it much less costly in terms of both
financial and human
resources.

<p><b>Perinatal Transmission. </b>I wasn't able to attend any
meetings addressing this subject, but
it appeared from the agenda as though there will be a good number of
progressive studies on the
drawing board utilizing the latest potent therapy advances, finally.  It
was mentioned at the ACTG
meeting that because Downstate in Brooklyn, N.Y. was defunded as a site,
gynecological studies in
general were not recruiting well because of the major contribution
Downstate made to the
overall recruitment of these studies.

<p><b>Pediatrics. </b>It appears to me as though there are some
important advances finally being made
for the pediatrics populations. Agouron has a good tasting pediatric
formulation in study since
June. As well, an additional peds trial is being discussed for the ACTG.
ACTG 338 will randomize
240 kids (ages 2-17) between AZT/3TC, RTN/AZT/3TC and d4T/RTN. The 48-week
study is
expected to begin in about 4 weeks with continuation of drug upon study
completion. This study
will be for less advanced children and a study for more advanced children
will follow. Andrew
Wiznia, a study co-chair from Bronx-Lebanon, described a unique study
design, in that it will
allow for folding into the study additional treatment arms over the entire
course of the trial. At
completion, all the different treatment arms will be compared. The adults
should consider
getting so creative. As well, a full panel of immune markers will be
examined including memory
and naive cells.

<p>One ACTG study utilizing 1592U89 has already started or will very soon
begin. Another is slated
to begin by March 1997. A pharmacokinetics (PK) study is expected to be
conducted for
neonates examining treatment intervention both within 72 hours of birth and
within 21-28
days of birth. A single dose PK study has started or is about to start,
examining 4 dose levels for
children aged 5-13. Further peds trials are planned using 141W94. As well,
Abbott is
suggesting a range of different types of studies for peds including
protease-protease
combinations.

<p><b>Protease Failures.</b>A very important study: Dr. Roy
Gulick, of NYU, and the ACTG, are
planning ACTG 359 which will explore options for these individuals. It will
be a mid-sized,
multi-center pilot trial expected to begin by the end of the 1st quarter of
97. Discussions are
ongoing about 3-drug combinations utilizing the new saquinavir formulation
(enhanced oral
formulation), nelfinavir, delavirdine, and ritonavir. Study participants
will probably be
stratified by CD4 count and viral load.


<p><b>ACTG 333. </b>Preliminary data is expected to be
available in 1st QTR 1997. This is first
protease inhibitor cross-resistance study; study participants with at least
1 year saquinavir
experience were randomized to either the saquinavir EOF (new enhanced oral
formulation with
higher bioavailability) or indinavir;  parameters of resistance and
cross-resistance are being
explored.

<h3>Ritonavir + AZT + ddC</h3>

<p><strong>Abstract (Birmingham, England) November 1996</strong>

<p>This is the 72-week follow-up data of this study, reported by Dr. Jean-Pierre
Chauvin of Abbott-France.

<p>This is an open-label pilot study of antiretroviral-naive individuals
with moderately
advanced HIV. All study participants received open-label 600 mg twice per
day (every 12
hrs) of ritonavir for 14 days followed by the addition of 200 mg three
times per day
(every 8 hrs) of AZT and 0.75 mg three times per day of ddC. Study participants
initiated therapy with the ritonavir liquid formulation, and were switched
to the oral
gel capsule formulation of ritonavir after 54 weeks.

<p>A total of 32 patients were enrolled with the following entry criteria:
baseline CD4
counts of between 50 and 250; or, a drop of 200 cells to a level of less
than 350 cells
over a recent 6 month period; or, 250 to 350 cells with symptoms.

<p>Mean and median baseline CD4 counts were 170 and 152, respectively; mean
plasma viral
load and cellular viral load levels were 4.7 log (about 50,000 copies/ml--
the Roche
RT-PCR test with lower limit of detection of 200 copies/ml), and 3.2 logs
per 107
cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture), respectively.

<p>Chauvin reported 11 patient discontinuations after 24 weeks-- 6 with
ritonavir-related
adverse events and 5 with non-ritonavir related adverse events; 21
completed 24 weeks;
subsequently, there were 4 additional discontinuations as 17 completed 72 weeks.

<p><strong>Plasma Viral Load.</strong> At 72 weeks, the mean reduction in
viral load was about 1.9 logs
from baseline for 17 evaluable study participants, compared to decreases of
1.94 at 24
weeks, and 1.6 at 52 weeks. The proportion of patients with viral load
below the lower
limit of detection (200 copies/ml) was about 52% (n=17) at 72 weeks,
compared to about
48% at 28 weeks, and 22% at 52 weeks.

<p>Mean cellular viremia (infectious cells) was about 2.5 logs below
baseline at 72 weeks,
compared to decreases of 1.06 logs at week 2, 2.41 logs at week 24, and
about 2.4 logs
at 52 weeks. About 70% of patients (n=17) had negative HIV cell cultures
(defined as
less than 5 infectious cells per 107 PBMC) at week 72, compared to about
60% at week 60
(n=15).

<p><strong>CD4.</strong>  The mean CD4 increases from baseline were about
160 at week 72 (n=17), compared
to increases of 130 at week 24, and 170 at week 52.

<p>The dose escalation method, which is now recommended for ritonavir, was
not used in
this study. A total of 6 patients discontinued due to GI intolerance; two
patients
discontinued due to liver toxicity (one grade III, one grade IV); several
patients
experienced elevated triglyceride levels.

<p><strong>Commentary: </strong>When comparing viral load changes and the
proportion with undetectable
viral load from the time point of prior to 52 weeks and after 52 weeks,
bear in mind
that at about 52 weeks, patients were switched from the oral liquid
ritonavir to the
gel capsules. Apparently, compliance may have improved after the switch to
the gel
capsule.

<h3> Ritonavir + AZT + 3TC</h3>

<p><strong>Abstract (Birmingham, England) November 1996</strong>

<p>Thirty-one treatment-naive individuals were randomized to begin triple
therapy
(ritonavir 600 mg + AZT 300 mg + 3TC 150 mg--all 3 drugs were administered
twice daily
(every 12 hours, bid) simultaneously or to the delayed group where ritonavir was
initiated alone followed by the addition of AZT and 3TC three weeks later. The
immediate vs delayed comparison is to detect if there is a difference in
effect due to
the 3-week delay in adding AZT/3TC. Dr. Sven Danner, of the University of
Amsterdam,
reported the preliminary virological and immunological data from this ongoing
open-label two arm study. Dr. Daan Notermans, of the Academic Medical Center in
Amsterdam, reported results from a study of the RNA load in the lymphoid
tissue from
tonsillar biopsies of 6 study participants who continued on treatment in this
ritonavir/AZT/3TC study.

<p>Group 1, the immediate group had median baseline RNA, CD4 and CD8 of
5.27 log (about
187,000 copies/ml), 177 cells, and 1,027 cells, respectively. Group 2,
which delayed
AZT/3TC for 3 weeks, had median baseline RNA, CD4 and CD8 of 5.37 (about 235,000
copies/ml), 134 cells, and 927 cells.

<p><strong>CD4.</strong> For group 1 (the immediate group, baseline=177
CD4) at 8 weeks, there was about a
100 cell median increase from baseline (n=16); for group 2 (delayed,
baseline= 134
cells), there was about a 75 cell median increase from baseline (n=16); at
12 weeks,
the median CD4 increase from baseline was about 130 for group 1 (n=16) and
about 80 for
group 2 (n=16); at 24 weeks, the median CD4 increase was about 175 for the
immediate
(group 1, n=9) group and about 100 for the delayed (group 2, n=12) group.

<p><strong>CD8. </strong>For the immediate-group 1 (baseline=1027), there
was a median cell increase from
baseline of about 150 at week 8, 100 cells decrease below baseline at week
16, and back
to about a 200 increase above baseline at week 24; for the delayed-group 2
(baseline=
927), the median increase from baseline was about 200 at week 8, a 50 cell
increase
above baseline at week 16; at week 24, the CD8 was about equal to the baseline.

<p><strong>Plasma Viral Load. </strong>During the initial 4 weeks of
therapy, the reduction in viral RNA
appears to decline slightly more steeply and quickly for the immediate
group than the
delayed group; however, at week 4 (AZT/3TC is added at week 3) the median
decline from
baseline appears about equal for both groups at about 2.2 log. At weeks 8
and 12 (2.5
and 2.6 vs 2.6 and 2.75), the reduction in RNA is slightly more for the
delayed group
than for the immediate group; but, by week 16 both groups have pulled to
about even in
their median reduction from baseline in viral load (about 2.8 log for both
groups); at
week 24, both groups appear to have about equal reductions in viral load of
about 2.8
log.

<p>The CD4, CD8 and viral load numbers (including those in the tables) are
based upon
estimations of line graphs, and therefore are approximations.

<p><strong>Proportion with RNA Below Detectability.</strong> For those
study participants who remained on
full doses of study medications (some study participants discontinued or
interrupted
therapy), 100% in group 1 (immediate) were below detectability (the Roche
Amplicor test
was used with a median lower level of detection of 238 copies/ml) at week
16; about 85%
of those in group 2 (delayed) were undetectable at week 16; at week 24 100%
of both
groups were below the limit of detection.

<p><strong>Adverse Events and Withdrawals.</strong> A total of 8 study
participants (24%) withdrew from
study (5 were in immediate-group 1, and 3 were in delayed-group 2). Of the
5 group 1
individuals who withdrew, one withdrawal each occurred in weeks 5, 8, 12,
and 20.Of
the 3 group 2 individuals who withdrew, one each occurred at weeks 13, 16,
and 24. The
frequency of occurrence of adverse events given as reason for withdrawal:
nausea and/or
vomiting- 7; asthenia or malaise- 5; diarrhea- 3; abdominal pain- 2;
dizziness- 1;
night sweats- 1; palpitations- 1; some individuals complained of multiple
adverse
events as reasons for withdrawal.

<p>Dr. Danner said, the results obtained to date do not point to a difference in
antiretroviral potential between the two groups over the first three weeks;
also he
said, the incomplete reduction in viral load seen after 3 weeks (when
compared to the
reduction seen after 16 weeks) is not due to lack of potency, nor to
rapidly developing
resistance. He reported, one patient had mutations at 41 and 215, but was still
undetectable; and, another patient had a V82A mutation after a few weeks,
but was also
undetectable. At baseline, two patients had A71T mutations and another had
an A71V
mutation.

<p><strong>Lymphoid Tissue. </strong>For each of the six participants who
received tonsillar biopsies,
investigators have baseline and six month values. Investigators said, 90% of a
tonsillar biopsy consists of lymphoid tissue (Haase et al, Science, in
press 1996);
and, tonsillar biopsy, under local anasthesia is a safe and simple
procedure. The
tissue RNA load was measured with the Chiron ultra-sensitive bDNA test. The
lower limit
of detection of the test is 500 copies; this calculates to 30,000 copies
per gram of
tissues (or 30 copies per mg of tissue) and is 1.84 log. Notermans reported
that by
week 24, in all of the six patients, the tissue RNA was below the limit of
detection of
the test (500 copies).

<p>Notermans requested that standards for anti-retroviral therapy be reset
to include
reducing HIV RNA levels in the lymphoid tissue in addition to reduction in the
peripheral blood. He continued: "we need to follow-up to see how sustained the
suppression is; and, we need to know other things, such as what happens to
the level of
pro-viral DNA in the lymphoid tissue. Even if we manage to suppress the
virus strong
and long enough, is reconstruction of the immune system possible"?

<p><strong>Commentary. </strong>Although the lymph tissue load was below
500 copies, residual virus may
still be present and replicating. We don't yet understand the implications.
Other
researchers present at this meeting, said more refined methodology need to
be used; a
more refined methodology may yield a more definitive understanding of virus
activity in
lymph tissue. A goal is to be able to correlate virus activity in lymph
tissue with
virus activity in plasma (blood circulation). If a correlation can be
established, it
may not be necessary to measure viral burden in lymph tissue. There is
controversy
about pro-viral DNA. If present, some believe it may be defective and not
significant,
while others do not agree and think the presence of pro-viral DNA is important.

<h3> RITONAVIR + SAQUINAVIR</h3>

<p><strong>Abstract (Birmingham, England)</strong>

<p>At the 3rd International Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV Infection, in
early November
'96,  Dr. William Cameron of the University of Ottawa in Canada presented
data from
extended follow-up of participants in both Groups I and II, for the
aforementioned
study of individuals receiving the combination of the two protease inhibitors.

<p>The data for Group I (treatment arm A--400 mg bid RTV+400 mg bid SQV,
and treatment arm
B--600 mg bid RTV+400 mg bid SQV) extends to 20 weeks. The data for Group
II (treatment
 arm C--400 mg tid RTV+400 mg tid SQV, and treatment  arm D--600 mg bid
RTV+600 mg bid
SQV) extends to 12 weeks for this data set.

<p>For the participants in treatment arm A, the median CD4 increase from
baseline and
median viral load decrease at 20 weeks are 75 CD4 and 3.21 log.  For the
participants
in arm B, the median CD4 increase was 120 cells from baseline; the median
decrease from
baseline in viral load was 3.17 log. About 80% of the 51 evaluable
participants from
arms A and B were below the limit of detection, for viral load, of 200
copies/ml.

<p>The participants in treatment arm C, at 12 weeks, experienced a median
reduction in
viral load from baseline of 2.68 log, and a median increase from baseline
in CD4 of
about 100. The participants in arm D experienced a median CD4 increase of
120, and a
median reduction in viral load of 2.73. At 12 weeks, for arms C and D, the
proportion
of evaluable study participants below the limit of detection, for viral
load, was 75%
and 70%, respectively.

<p><strong>Commentary: </strong>The differences in viral load and CD4
between groups or arms are not
statistically significant. It is uncertain which of the dose regimens may
be superior
simply by comparing CD4 and viral load differences.

<p><strong>Commentary: </strong>In table 6, the side effects and lab
abnormalties profiles are more
favorable for the 400/400 bid group. Note the discontinuations in the 400/400 tid
group. The 600/600 group have the highest incidence of ADEs and lab
abormalities. In
table 7, participants with normal baseline LFTs (SGPT) and who are
Hepatitis B and
Hepatitis C antibody negative, have a lower incidence of elevations of
LFTs. Those with
Hepatitis B or C antibody at baseline indicate higher incidence of elevated
LFTs. But,
it appears to be the 600/600 bid regimen that causes the highest incidence
of LFT
elevation. 20 weeks data is normally too short upon which to base treatment
decision
making.  However,  when selecting a dose regimen, you may want to consider
both--the
combination's efficacy (CD4 and viral load) as well as the safety and
tolerability
profile.

<p>Cameron showed a graph indicating that the drug concentration in the
plasma (blood
levels) of 600 mg bid dose of ritonavir is higher  than the plasma
concentrations of
400 mg bid ritonavir. Additionally, the chart indicated using 600 mg bid
ritonavir
raises the both the plasma concentration level and trough level of
saquinavir above
those resulting from combining only 400 mg bid ritonavir with the same dose of
saquinavir.

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Like all children, those with HIV infection benefit from
periodic health evaluations. Periodic comprehensive evaluations are critical
for healthy child care (immunizations and general health maintenance),
care for acute and chronic illnesses, and evaluation for prophylactic intervent
ions
to prevent opportunistic infections. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Most care for children exposed to HIV is provided on an
outpatient basis. HIV testing should be considered for children with certain
physical findings* and for children who experience unusual courses of routine
childhood illness (e.g., severe or prolonged varicella or diarrhea). Following
are some guidelines for the primary care of children with HIV infection
or exposure. </FONT></P>

infection has been reasonably excluded should be seen every 2 to 3 months
until 18 months of age. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Children with confirmed HIV infection should be seen monthly
for the first 2 years of life; those with minimal or no symptoms may require
less frequent evaluations after 2 years of age, but they should continue
to be seen at a minimum of every 3 months for CD4 lymphocyte monitoring
and clinical reevaluation. (See <A HREF="#table 1">Table 1</A> and <A

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing should be used to establish or
exclude infection. Two negative PCR tests (both obtained at 1 month of
age or older, one at 4 months of age or older) reasonably exclude infection.
Two or more positive PCR tests on different samples are required to establish
infection. (PCR testing is available through the New York State Department
of Health.) </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>HIV serology <BR>
</B>For children with negative PCR tests, obtain confirmatory HIV serology
by age 12 months. Seroreversion is defined as 2 negative antibody tests
6 months apart. Other HIV tests (viral culture, PCR antigen testing) may
be used if available. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Children who present for care without evidence of PCR testing or who are
of unknown serostatus should have 2 negative antibody test results 6 months
apart, or 1 negative test result at 18 months of age or older. </FONT></LI>

receiving ZDV. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Immunologic monitoring</B> (<A HREF="#table 4">See
Table 4</A>) <BR>
Monitor CD4 count every 3 months to evaluate need for prophylaxis (PCP,
MAC). Quantitative immunoglobulins should be obtained at about six months
of age. IVIG may be used for treatment of significant hypogammaglobulinemia.
</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Hepatitis B serology</B> (See <A HREF="#table 1">Table
1</A>) <BR>
Test at birth or at initial visit. If mother is HBsAg positive at the child's
birth, the child should receive hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis
B vaccine. It is recommended that all infants receive hepatitis B vaccine
according to published guidelines. Hepatitis serology may be rechecked
at 9 to 12 months of age. If patient is seronegative, a fourth dose of
vaccine should be given. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Vaccinate according to schedule (See <A HREF="#table 3">Table 3</A>)
</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Syphilis serology</B> (See <A HREF="#table 1">Table
1</A>) <BR>
Test at birth or at initial visit. The infant seropositive for syphilis
and HIV at birth should be given systemic penicillin for at least 10 days.
Serology should be retested at 3, 6, and 12 months, or until non-reactive.

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The steady increase in the proportion of substance users
with HIV infection in New York State heightens the need for effective integration
of substance use management and primary care. A full understanding of the
clinical and behavioral manifestations of substance use, the assessment
tools used in its diagnosis, and the broad range of options available to
treat it enhance the primary practitioner's ability to coordinate care
and influence behavior change. Primary care providers have a central role
in on-going assessment and coordination of medical care for substance users
with HIV infection, including evaluation of substance use and relapse,
and response to drug treatment. This protocol emphasizes aspects of substance
use management most relevant to primary care. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Transmission of HIV has been most commonly linked to parenteral
drug use. The use of non-parenteral drugs, particularly crack and alcohol,
is also associated with HIV transmission, primarily because of cognitive
impairment, disinhibition in sexual activity, and sexual activity exchanged
for drugs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition to facilitating the spread of HIV, substance
use also influences the manifestations of HIV illness. Medical signs and
symptoms in a chemically dependent individual with HIV infection should
be interpreted in the contexts of both HIV and drug addiction, thus expanding
differential diagnoses for weight loss, abdominal pain, lymphadenopathy,
thrombocytopenia, and other common signs of HIV infection. Knowledge of
the medical sequelae of drug use is therefore essential for the formulation
of an effective treatment plan for substance users who are infected with
HIV. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Identification of substance use, and assessment of its
medical impact on the patient, require history, physical examination, and
laboratory evaluations. The diagnosis of substance use can be more difficult
in earlier stages of drug addiction but may become more easily recognized
in later stages, when a clinical complication brings the patient's addiction
to the provider's attention. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Drug addiction can be a chronic, relapsing syndrome, characterized
by periods of abstinence and recurrence of substance use. The clinician
should be aware of signs and symptoms associated with relapse and take
appropriate steps to manage medical and behavioral complications as they
occur. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Primary care providers have an obligation to inform patients
about drug treatment options and to assist them in entering treatment if
they so desire. The primary care provider should provide the substance
user with advice about behaviors that will reduce the risk of HIV transmission
to the patient and others, consistent with the principles of harm reduction.
Treatment of HIV and drug addiction is best accomplished through a multidisciplinary
effort involving the patient, clinician, case manager, drug treatment provider,
and social service provider. </FONT>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="clinican"></A>The Clinician-Patient Relationship </H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>While drug addiction and HIV disease may at times present
management difficulties for health care professionals, both substance users
and patients with HIV deserve access to quality medical care. A trusting
clinician-patient relationship that fosters an atmosphere of mutual respect
is essential to a productive primary care environment. Such issues as collaborative
decision making, agreement on boundaries, and responsibilities of the patient
and health care provider should be addressed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>To enhance communication between clinician and patient,
the clinician should follow these recommendations: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Express an empathic, non-judgmental attitude.</B>
Use of a supportive interviewing style will help the patient feel secure
enough to speak freely, thus facilitating disclosure of pertinent information.
</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Emphasize confidentiality.</B> As is the case with
everything discussed in the medical setting, all matters pertaining to
the patient's past or present substance use are as confidential as any
other medical information. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Consider timing.</B> Although it is usually advisable
to conduct the substance use history during the initial interview, the
clinician should be aware that the patient's readiness to disclose information
may increase as the clinician-patient relationship grows. </FONT></LI>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="eval"></A>Evaluation of Substance Use </H3>

<P><B>SUBSTANCE USE HISTORY </B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The clinician should take a substance use history as part
of the routine medical history. The information gleaned from the substance
use history is necessary to formulate a comprehensive and effective treatment
plan. The clinician should be aware that willingness to disclose this information
may be affected by the patient's perceptions of social stigma, as well
as by feelings concerning drug use, addiction, relapse, and recovery. Consider
asking about the least emotionally charged substances first, as follows:
</FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><B>BEHAVIORAL ISSUES </B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The clinician should consider substance use when evaluating
a patient's agitation, depression, mood swings, mental status changes,
forgetfulness, or disorientation. Attention should also be given to diagnoses
known to be associated with substance use, such as depression, anxiety,
and antisocial disorders. Evaluation, treatment, and referral for concurrent
psychiatric disorders may be appropriate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Consider current substance use status or potential for
relapse when prescribing medications that may be used as intoxicants, may
potentiate other substances, or may be addictive. Examples of such drugs
include benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Psychiatric and substance use treatment services should
be coordinated to maximize their effectiveness. For example, depression
should be treated with antidepressants and psychotherapy in a patient who
uses substances to self-medicate depression. Clinicians should recognize
that patients with dual diagnoses (substance use and a psychiatric disorder)
may require psychiatric evaluation, management, and referral. </FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="exam"></A><B>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION </B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Acute intoxication or chronic substance use may be difficult
to detect, particularly in earlier stages of addiction. A complete physical
examination with attention to the following signs may assist the clinician
in differentiating patterns of drug use. </FONT></P>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="txref"></A>Substance Use Treatment and Referral </H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The HIV primary care provider should be directly involved
in selecting the appropriate treatment option for the patient who is a
substance user. Treatment planning should be a collaborative effort between
the clinician, patient, case manager, and substance use treatment program.
The following options should be considered in treatment planning. </FONT></P>

<H4><A NAME="detox"></A>Detoxification Programs </H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Detoxification should be considered strongly for people
physiologically addicted to alcohol, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates
because of the morbidity and mortality associated with withdrawal from
these substances. Detoxification may also be useful for polysubstance,
opiate, cocaine, or stimulant withdrawal. Long-range planning for follow-up
care after detoxification should be made for all patients concurrently
with referrals for detoxification. </FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Alcoholism</B> <BR>
These programs are medically directed detoxification programs that provide
24-hour care for patients who require hospitalization for treatment of
alcohol intoxication or withdrawal. They can be organized as separate units
of general or psychiatric hospitals. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Substance Use <BR>
</B>These programs offer specialized substance use services including medical
and pharmacological procedures used to prevent pain, discomfort, and possible
danger that can result from abrupt termination of a drug that has caused
physical dependence. Such programs are generally part of inpatient hospital
facilities that manage medical complications of physiologic withdrawal.
</FONT></P>
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="in"></A>Inpatient Treatment Programs </H4>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Alcoholism <BR>
</B>Programs include alcohol crisis centers that provide inpatient care
which may include treatment for withdrawal, but does not include medical
care services. Longer treatment is available through inpatient alcoholism
rehabilitation, an intensive program for people who require evaluation
and treatment services in a highly structured setting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Substance Use <BR>
</B>Inpatient substance use treatment and rehabilitation services may be
provided to patients who require medical management of their treatment
in addition to intensive or short-term substance use counseling. </FONT></P>

who are able to function in the community with the benefit of daily support
from an ambulatory treatment program. Comprehensive services include counseling,
vocational, educational, legal, mental health, alcoholism, and social services.
Some day-treatment programs are targeted specifically to women and women
with children. Medical services are generally provided through referral,
except in medically supervised day-service programs, in which limited medical
and psychiatric services are offered. </FONT></P>

<H4><A NAME="out"></A>Outpatient Treatment Services </H4>

provide special environments for specific subpopulations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Drug Treatment <BR>
</B>Substance use treatment services are provided in a nonresidential setting
under the general supervision of a licensed physician. Programs may be
either drug-free or methadone maintenance. Medically supervised programs
provide services under the general supervision of a licensed physician.
</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Methadone Maintenance Treatment Programs (MMTP) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Methadone maintenance treatment services use methadone,
administered over time, to relieve withdrawal symptoms, reduce cravings,
and permit normal functioning. These programs also offer a range of treatment
procedures and services for the rehabilitation of people dependent on opium,
morphine, heroin, or any opiate derivative. Services include counseling,
medical examinations, urine testing, and various support services. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Methadone blocks opiate receptors, reduces craving, blunts
the high from heroin or other opiate drugs, and permits normal patient
functioning. The following points are important to keep in mind when evaluating
the appropriateness of MMTP facilities for the substance-using patient.
</FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Admission <BR>
</B>After evaluation by methadone facility personnel and medical staff
at the MMTP, the patient will be given a starting dosage of methadone,
generally between 10 mg and 30 mg. If the patient enters the MMTP addicted
to a significant enough amount of street opiates, there may be an initial
period of discomfort associated with withdrawal as the patient is stabilized.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Maintenance <BR>
</B>Methadone dosage will be increased until the patient is stabilized.
Stabilization occurs after the patient ceases using street narcotics, which
is verified through interview and urine toxicology. Average methadone dosage
associated with stabilization is approximately 60 mg to 80 mg, although
some patients will require lower or higher dosages. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Hospitalization <BR>
</B>When patients are admitted to the hospital, methadone dosage should
always be verified with the treatment program. Methadone dosage changes
made during the hospitalization should be determined by collaboration of
MMTP counselors and medical staff. Detoxification from methadone is generally
ill advised. Associated withdrawal symptoms may result in patient agitation
and premature hospital discharge. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Drug Interactions <BR>
</B>Adverse interactions between methadone and other drugs have been well
documented. Drugs such as phenytoin, rifampin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine
create an increased need for methadone. Because patients with HIV often
take these medications, it is essential to be familiar with management
of these drug interactions. Withdrawal symptoms should be taken into consideration
and the patient should be evaluated accordingly. Pregnant women may also
require increased dosages, especially in the third trimester. </FONT></P>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Methadone-to-Abstinence Services</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Methadone-to-abstinence treatment programs provide methadone
maintenance services for a period exceeding 21 days, with a planned course
of treatment involving reduction in dosage to the point of abstinence.
Residential day-treatment and outpatient programs offer this service. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Twelve-Step Programs </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Twelve-step programs include Alcoholics Anonymous and
Narcotics Anonymous. Managed by recovering alcoholics and addicts, these
programs offer anonymity to their participants. Twelve-step programs are
utilized alone or in combination with another substance use treatment modality.
</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="harm"></A><B>Harm Reduction Programs</B></P>

<UL>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Syringe Exchange (Needle Exchange) Programs </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Syringe exchange programs provide a comprehensive public
health intervention that includes the exchange of clean syringes for used
ones within the context of a harm reduction approach. Services include
the provision of HIV prevention education; distribution and demonstration
of the use of bleach kits and condoms; risk reduction interventions addressing
both drug and sexual practices; and the provision of onsite or referrals
to social services and substance use treatment. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Recovery Readiness Programs </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Recovery readiness programs are based upon the recognition
that active drug users, especially crack and polysubstance users, have
complex needs that are often more immediate to them than drug treatment.
These programs organize substance use interventions around the provision
of basic services such as food, clothing, housing, primary health care,
and social services. They also provide social support to clients as they
move through the following stages of behavior change as described by Prochaska:
</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Precontemplation: no intention to change behavior in
the near future </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Contemplation: ambivalence about change </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Preparation: combination of intention and initial behavioral
change </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Action: modification of behavior or environment to overcome
problems </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Maintenance: work to prevent relapse and consolidate
change </FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Specific interventions, both individual and group, are
tailored to each of these stages. Programs that provide these services
do not require lengthy intake procedures and are easily accessible to clients.

<H3><A NAME="medical"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Medical Care Coordination</FONT></H3>

<P><B>Follow-up Care </B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>After referral to a drug treatment facility, the clinician
should assist in the coordination of ongoing care and monitor the patient
for potential relapse and response to ongoing treatment. The following
recommendations should be incorporated when providing primary care for
patients with HIV and substance use: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Make follow-up questions regarding substance use and
progress in treatment a routine part of office visits. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Include substance use in the medical problem list and
progress notes, with corresponding medical assessment and plan. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Maintain follow-up telephone contact with the patient's
drug treatment program. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Monitor missed appointments as a possible indicator of
relapse. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Replace lost prescriptions as medically indicated. If
diversion of prescriptions is suspected, patients should be directed to
appropriate administrative due process prior to disciplinary action. </FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Unexplained signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities
should prompt consideration of substance use as a potential underlying
etiology (e.g., weight loss, constipation, tremor). (See <A HREF="#review">Review
of Systems</A></FONT> <FONT SIZE=-1>) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Particular attention should be paid to lost prescriptions
for medications that may be used to become intoxicated or to self-medicate
against withdrawal symptoms. Such drugs include: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>benzodiazepines </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>barbiturates </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>opiates </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>NSAIDs (relieve withdrawal symptoms) </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>any medications that potentiate effect of alcohol </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>cimetidine (potentiates effect of alcohol) </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>tricyclic or any sedating antidepressants </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>any device that assists in the delivery of illicit substances
(asthma inhalers) </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>any drug that is expensive and that has a high street
market value. </FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Patients who arrive at the office intoxicated should be
medically evaluated. If the patient is too intoxicated to understand medical
instructions, the clinician may consider requesting that the patient return
to the office at a later time for further evaluation and treatment. Intoxication
is not an acceptable reason for dismissing a patient from a medical facility.
The episode of intoxication should be noted accordingly, and appropriate
plans should be made for medical and substance use treatment. </FONT></P>

<P><B>Emergency Room and Inpatient Management </B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Patients with known or suspected substance use history
should be promptly evaluated for intoxication, signs of overdose, and withdrawal
symptoms upon their arrival at an emergency facility or hospital ward.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Patients in withdrawal should be assessed for the need
for replacement medication while substance use assessment is being conducted.
Commonly used replacement medications include methadone, in dosages of
10 mg to 30 mg, which may be given to opiate-addicted patients; librium,
for alcohol withdrawal; and nicotine polacrilex (Nicorette<SUP>&reg;</SUP>)
or nicotine patches, which are used for nicotine withdrawal. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Because chemical dependency can be a lifetime syndrome,
decisions affecting the long-term course of addiction should be carefully
considered and made in conjunction with the patient's substance use treatment
facility. Follow-up plans should be carefully coordinated between the HIV
primary care clinician and the drug treatment facility. </FONT></P>

<P><B>Harm Reduction and HIV Primary Care<FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Substance use has been identified as one of the leading
causes of health problems in the United States. It has been linked to the
physiological effects of drugs (overdoses and alcoholic cirrhosis), antisocial
or violent behavior while under the influence (drunken driving and domestic
violence), and adverse consequences inherent in drug administration (carcinogens
in tobacco smoke; HIV and other serious infections transmitted through
shared injection equipment). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Because of the clear connection between substance use
and physical harm, and considering the connection between HIV and drug
addiction and relapse, it is essential that the physician play an aggressive
role in harm reduction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The goal of harm-reduction programs is to provide the
user with information that will help reduce the risk of HIV transmission.
Harm reduction models may be applied to a full spectrum of treatment, from
abstinence to relapse, and such programs recognize that the active intravenous
drug user can be part of a public health effort to control the sharing
of contaminated needles. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Providing active injectors with consistent access to information
that clearly defines HIV transmission routes, as well as the materials
necessary to practice hygiene, can help intravenous drug users significantly
reduce risk behaviors. In addition, since sexual partners of substance
users are also at risk for transmission of HIV, harm reduction efforts
should evaluate the potential risk to these persons and include safer
sex education and counseling. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Tuberculosis (TB) often develops as an opportunistic infection in people with HIV infection.The disease has been reported to occur in 5% to 21% of people with HIV infection. In certain areas of New York City, 50% to 80% of patients with active TB are HIV positive. Pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB are AIDS-defining illnesses for people with HIV infection.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>People with TB infection who are HIV seropositive are more likely to develop tuberculosis than those who are HIV seronegative. For example, for those who have been infected with M. tuberculosis, the risk of active TB disease in the general population is 10% per lifetime, but the risk for a person with HIV is 8% per year. Recent data also suggest that people with HIV develop active TB disease more rapidly once infected, and that exogenous reinfection can occur. In addition, coinfection with M. tuberculosis and other mycobacterial species can occur. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Tuberculosis should be considered whenever patients infected with HIV develop unexplained pulmonary symptoms, fever, or weight loss. Diagnosis of TB in persons with HIV is difficult because: 1) atypical pulmonary disease occurs more often than classical apical cavitary disease; 2) normal chest X-rays have been reported in people with active pulmonary disease;and 3) extrapulmonary disease occurs more frequently. Chest X-rays must be supplemented by sputum AFB smears and cultures in all symptomatic patients. Some patients with HIV infection who have had sputum cultures positive for M. tuberculosis have had sputum smears negative for AFB. In addition, the AFB smear is less specific for diagnosis of pulmonary TB in the patient with HIVinfection, since cultures often yield mycobacterial species other than M. tuberculosis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><I>All persons with HIV infection should be tested using purified protein derivative (PPD).</I>Tuberculin reactions of 5 mm or greater are considered positive for people with HIV infection. Since PPD testing may be unreliable in immunosuppressed patients with HIV, anergy testing should be performed at the same time. &gt;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Antituberculous chemotherapy should be initiated whenever AFB are found on smear, pending culture results. Unexplained clinical or radiographic pulmonary disease in persons with HIV should prompt consideration of antituberculous therapy. The duration of both prophylaxis and therapy in most protocols is longer than for seronegative persons. &gt; </FONT> <HR></P>

<H3><a name="diag">Diagnosis</H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>PPD TESTING</B> (See<A HREF="#ppd"> PPD Testing</A> protocol.)</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>All individuals with HIV infection who do not have a documented history of tuberculosis or a positive PPD test should be tested using PPD.</FONT></LI>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Nutrition is an essential component of the medical management of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hypermetabolism, altered fat and protein metabolism, malabsorption, and especially inadequate intake can all cause severe weight loss. Loss of lean body mass (LBM) is a hallmark of malnutrition and can have severe clinical implications. In addition, many single micronutrient deficiencies occur in patients with HIV. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Considerable data suggest that malnutrition alters the course of HIV infection. Protein calorie malnutrition, commonly seen in HIV infection, can result in a worsening of cellular immunity and a reduction in functional ability. In addition, loss of lean body mass shortens survival. Preservation of body weight and lean body mass and prevention of micronutrient deficiencies are important goals in the primary care of people with HIV infection. </FONT> <HR><A NAME="protein"></A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Protein-Calorie Malnutrition</FONT></H3>

<UL>
 <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Protein calorie malnutrition (PCM) results when absorbed calories and protein do not meet the patient's metabolic needs. To prevent PCM, monitor food intake and look for problems that limit intake. Additional calories will most likely promote anabolism during times of medical stability. Treatment of underlying infections is especially important for weight to increase. During acute illnesses, prevent additional LBM loss. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Weight loss with decreased body fat or muscle points to the presence of possible PCM. Look for bitemporal, truncal, and other muscle wasting. Weigh patients regularly and monitor losses carefully. Monitor laboratory indices of protein malnutrition. Serum albumin is a good indicator of protein status when patients are not acutely ill. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Plan interventions early, before debilitating losses have occurred. These may include regular nutrition counseling and assessment by a registered dietitian, initiation of nutrition supplements, the use of anabolic agents, appetite stimulants, and anticytokine agents. If intake remains poor and the patient continues to lose weight, the use of enteral or parenteral feeding should be considered. </FONT></LI> </UL>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>All patients with increased metabolic needs require additional calories and protein to maintain or replenish weight and protein stores. During illness, however, intake is often diminished. REE may continue to increase, exacerbating wasting. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Although patients with active infections have elevations in their metabolic rates, they may be unable to utilize excess calories. Loss of lean body mass is inevitable. Without treatment of the underlying infection, nutrition support may be of little benefit. </FONT></LI> </UL>

<UL>
 <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Overproduction of cytokines may result in ineffective utilization of fat stores as a fuel source. This may lead to increases in serum triglycerides. The preferred fuel source becomes protein which results in further loss of lean body mass. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Cholestasis, uremia, and hyperglycemia can be caused by nutrition support without any significant reduction in weight loss. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Unless patients have a significant short-term risk for heart disease, a moderate elevation in serum triglycerides is not of significant concern. Levels greater than 1000 mg/dL can lead to a risk of acute pancreatitis. Didanosine therapy may exacerbate this risk. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Treatment of wasting is difficult. Several treatments under investigation are being used by some clinicians. Each has potential benefits, as well as toxicities. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Texture changes may be necessary for some patients. Whole foods should be maintained as much as possible. Assess each patient's tolerance for different textures: soft, mashed, pureed, or liquid. Focus on high-calorie, nutrient-dense foods. The use of commercial liquid nutrition supplements should be encouraged.</FONT></LI> </UL>

<UL>
 <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Poor appetite, common in patients with HIV, can occur from both physiologic and psychological causes. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Nutrient-dense foods and small, frequent meals should be recommended. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Relaxation techniques before meals may help increase food tolerance. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Appetite stimulants should be considered, such as: </FONT></LI>

<UL>
 <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Megestrol acetate, a synthetic progesterone that promotes weight gain and minimizes protein loss. Dose is 600-800 mg/day. The oral suspension has 400 mg/10 cc. Although the largest component of weight gain is fat, lean body mass losses are diminished; therefore megestrol acetate improves protein status. Side effects may include amenorrhea and adrenal insufficiency. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Dronabinol, synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a derivative of marijuana. Controlled trials show significant appetite stimulation but insignificant weight gain. The usual dose is 2.5 mg b.i.d. It can be given as 5 mg at bedtime to limit central nervous system side effects. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Cyproheptadine. There are no controlled trials as to efficacy, but this antihistamine is known to be safe. </FONT></LI> </UL> </UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Unproven Nutrition Therapies</B> </FONT></P>

<UL>
 <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Unproven nutrition therapies are often attempted by patients with HIV. The most common are the whole foods diet, macrobiotic diet, yeast-free diet, vitamin and mineral megadosing, and use of herbs. These alternative approaches have both benefits and potential problems. It is important to remember that vitamin, calorie, and protein deficiencies may be caused by these diets, as well as hypervitaminosis, and toxicities from herbal preparations. </FONT></LI> </UL>

<P><A NAME="diarrhea"></A></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>DIARRHEA </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Diarrhea is common in patients with HIV. The workup should assess etiology and evaluate for malabsorption. Nutrient intake should be ensured. If possible, the underlying disease should be treated. If malabsorption is suspected, the patient with diarrhea may need referral to a specialist. To foster improved absorption of nutrients, use elemental, semi-elemental, or medium chain-triglyceride (MCT) containing oral or enteral feedings. If these are not tolerated, parenteral nutrition must be considered. </FONT><A NAME="prevent"></A></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>PREVENTING AND TREATING PROTEIN-CALORIE MALNUTRITION</B> </FONT></P>

<UL>
 <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Prevention of weight loss should be a goal for patients with HIV infection and their health care providers. Since weight gain can be very difficult, strategies should be developed to limit weight loss. Patients should be advised to monitor their weight and report any significant loss. If appetite disorder (anorexia) is the cause of reduced intake, patients should be counseled to eat calorie-dense foods. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>For many patients, further attempts should be made to increase the caloric content of the diet before adding supplements. Home shakes can be prepared with ice cream and instant breakfast powders. Lactase enzyme may increase the tolerance for these milk-based shakes. </FONT></LI> </UL>

<H4>FEEDING GUIDELINES AND METHODS</H4>

<P><A NAME="oral"></A></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Oral Nutrition</B> </FONT></P>

<UL>
 <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Counsel the patient to maintain a high-calorie, high-protein, well-balanced diet, and to take a daily multiple-vitamin with minerals supplement. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>When a patient is unable to maintain adequate intake, oral nutrition supplements can be used as an addition to the diet. These supplements will usually increase daily calorie intake by 20%. Most are available as liquid drinks but may also be available as puddings, bars, and soups. They should be used as additions to food, not as substitutes. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Certain micronutrients play an important role in the maintenance of cell-mediated immunity, including vitamins A and E, and minerals such as zinc, iron, and selenium. Nutrition supplements should include replacement of these micronutrients. Supplementation with dosages significantly larger than the RDA has not been proven to have impact on morbidity or mortality. </FONT></LI> </UL>

<P><A NAME="aggressive"></A></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Aggressive Nutrition Therapies</B> </FONT></P>

<UL>
 <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>If the underlying disease cannot be controlled, the clinician must assess whether additional intake or nutrition support will be of any benefit. If anabolism is not achieved with oral intake alone, aggressive nutrition therapies may be indicated. Benefits and risks should be assessed on an individual basis. The desired benefit is preservation of lean body mass and/or functional ability. Modes of intervention include enteral (tube) feeding and peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN). </FONT><A NAME="enteral"></A></LI>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Enteral Feedings </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
 <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Tube feeding may be appropriate for the patient whose gastrointestinal tract is working well but who is unable to consume adequate calories orally. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube may be indicated if long-term feedings are necessary. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>If feedings are short-term, a feeding tube (8 French) can be placed nasogastrically or nasoduodenally. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Use either method continuously if most calories are obtained from the feeding, or only at night if the feeding is supplemental. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Choose a formula based on the principles discussed under <A HREF="#supp">Nutrition Supplements</A>. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Potential risks include inability to tolerate feeding tube (pain or discomfort at the tube site), regurgitation or aspiration of formula (keep head of bed elevated 20<SUP>o</SUP> to 30<SUP>o</SUP>), and diarrhea (which can be due to bacterial contamination, antibiotic use, high osmolality). </FONT></LI> </UL>

<P><A NAME="parenteral"></A></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Parenteral Feedings </FONT></B></P>

<UL>
 <LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Parenteral nutrition may be appropriate for patients with malabsorption, or when tube feedings are not feasible. PPN may be appropriate when short-term nutrition support is necessary and tube feeding is not feasible. Before starting parenteral nutrition support, the practitioner should consult a registered dietitian, pharmacist, or specially trained physician. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Potential risks specific to PPN include infiltration and phlebitis as well as problems with lipid clearance. Additionally, PPN has all the metabolic complications of TPN. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>TPN may be appropriate when long-term nutrition support is necessary and tube feeding is not feasible. The standard TPN formula is more calorically dense than PPN and has a more balanced caloric distribution. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Potential risks of TPN include catheter-related sepsis (bacterial or fungal), endocarditis, thrombosis, and pneumothorax during catheter insertion. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Metabolic abnormalities with the use of PPN or TPN include electrolyte imbalances, hyperglycemia, iron and other micronutrient deficiencies, inadequate lipid clearance, abnormal liver enzymes, and cholestasis. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Obtain a baseline serum triglyceride level before beginning parenteral nutrition, then 24 to 48 hours after initiation and then weekly to assess adequate clearance of lipids. Monitor serum electrolytes (including phosphate and magnesium), albumin, liver enzymes, and body weight on a regular basis. Components of TPN solutions may be modified based upon careful monitoring. </FONT></LI> </UL>

<P><A NAME="supp"></A></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Nutrition Supplements </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Palatability is a major issue for products given orally. For patients without absorption problems, standard formulas, which often are less expensive and more palatable, should be selected. Since many patients find the commercial supplements unpalatable, flavor enhancers can be added, such as chocolate syrup. Many liquid nutrition supplements are available for use as a complete tube feeding. </FONT></P>

<UL>
 <LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Osmolality</B> <BR>
High osmolality products used in tube feeding (not as oral supplementation) can lead to diarrhea. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Calorie Concentration</B> <BR>
Products range from 1 to 2 calories/cc. Those with higher caloric density allow increased calories in less volume, and are usually higher in fat. The higher caloric density products are often quite viscous, which can limit palatability. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Protein</B> <BR>
Standard formulas with polypeptides should be used for patients who can absorb whole protein. Use elemental formulas with single amino acids or semi-elemental formulas with small peptides for patients who malabsorb or maldigest proteins. Small peptides and single amino-acids are often bitter in flavor. Products vary in total protein content, usually from 35 g/L to 85 g/L. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Lactose</B> <BR>
Nearly all commercial nutrition supplements are lactose-free. Puddings and instant breakfast products are not lactose-free. Lactase enzyme can be helpful with such products. Soy milk with added flavor-enhancers or lactase milk can also be used instead of regular milk. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Fat</B> <BR>
Standard formulas that have vegetable oil should be used for patients who can absorb fats. Products with monounsaturated fat and omega-3 fatty acids may be of benefit to patients with HIV infection. Elemental or semi-elemental products contain very little fat, or have most of their fat as MCT. High MCT-containing products with intact protein are available. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Gluten</B> <BR>
Nearly all commercial nutrition supplements are gluten-free. </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Fiber</B> <BR>
Products with added fiber can be useful for patients with non-malabsorptive diarrhea to assist with bulking. Products with guar gum or other soluble fibers may have additional benefits. Soluble fiber is fermented in the large intestine to short-chain fatty acids which is a preferred fuel for the large intestine. </FONT></LI> </UL> </UL>

<H4>Nutrition in Pediatric HIV Infection</H4>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Nutrition is essential to maintain health for all children, particularly those with HIV infection. Children require a high caloric intake to sustain growth. Increased caloric requirements due to stress, decreased nutrient absorption, and altered intake may, singly or in combination, lead to growth failure in children with HIV infection.

<p><b><a name="Introduciones">Introducion</a> al Grupo, el Boletin y el Trabajo</b><br>
<i>por James Learned</i></p>

<p>Bienvenido al primero de las ediciones en espa&ntilde;ol de Notas de la Clandestinidad, el bolet&iacute;n del People With AIDS Health Group. Hemos publicado desde 1990, y muchos de nuestros articulos y hojas de hechos han estado traducidos y publicados en boletines por todo el pa&iacute;s, ya era hora que le dedicaramos una edici&oacute;n a nuestros hermanos y hermanas de habla espa&ntilde;ola. </p>

<p>Entonces, &#191;quienes somos? Principalmente, somos un ‘club de compradores’. El PWA Health Group, fundado en 1987 por Thomas Hannan y Michael Callen, ambos PWAs, y su m&eacute;dico, Dr. Joseph Sonnabend, como una organizaci&oacute;n sin fines de lucro. Importamos medicamentos del mundo entero que no est&aacute;n aprobados por el FDA en los E.U. (por razones economicas, generalmente) y los ofrec&eacute;mos al costo a la gente viviendo con VIH/SIDA como un parte de las opciones de su tratamiento.</p>

<p>Hace 10 a&ntilde;os, la gente, por lo menos los que permit&iacute;an, viajaba a M&eacute;xico, Am&eacute;rica del Sur, Europa, etc., para traer medicamentos prometedores en un base individual. Claro que la mayoria no pod&iacute;an permitirse aquel tipo de viaje, incluso por un tratamiento salvavida. Entonces el PWA Health Group y otros clubes de compradores se levant&oacute; de pronto para importar medicamentos en una base colectiva-como una cooperativa de comida, pero en vez de comida, medicamento. Eso es lo que y&aacute; hacemos. Durante los a&ntilde;os el PWA Health Group h&aacute; ofrecido casi todo antibi&oacute;tico importante contra infecciones oportunistas, meses o a&ntilde;os antes de la aprobaci&oacute;n del FDA. La lista de lo que ofrecemoscambia con tiempo, pero la intenci&oacute;n es la misma-proveer tratamientos.</p>

<p>La mayor&iacute;a de nuestros medicamentos son caros, a&uacute;n vendido a costo. Con la ayuda financiera de muchos donadores, nosotros podemos cortar por 30% el costo para los que tiene Medicaid y Medicare. Entonces, el costo de un medicamento no deber&iacute;a prevenir de presentarse aqu&iacute;. </p>

<p>Operamos abiertamente sobre las reglas de ‘uso personal’ del FDA, que permitir que una persona pueda importar una provisi&oacute;n de tres meses de un medicamento aprobado en cualquier pa&iacute;s para uso proprio. Suena f&aacute;cil, y aparte de un poco de oposici&oacute;n del FDA, en la mayor&iacute;a de los casos es simples. Creemos que es importante a acordar que cada vez que Ud. compra algun medicamento aqu&iacute; es una acci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica. Durante todo la historia de la crisis del SIDA, personas seropositivas han rehusado aceptar como infalible la sab&iacute;duria supuesta del gobierno, la profesi&oacute;n m&eacute;dica y la ind&uacute;stria farmac&eacute;utica. Ponemos en duda, argumentamos y confrontamos; y por todo esto, hacemos decisiones de tratamiento individuales y educadas que son correctas para cada uno de nosotros.</p>

<p>La abogac&iacute;a es otra parte grande de lo que hagamos en el PWA Health Group. Hablamos, perguntamos, hostigamos y confrontamos las compa&ntilde;ias farmac&eacute;uticas, el FDA y otras ag&eacute;ncias gubernamentales para aumentar aceso y bajar los precios de los medicamentos nesecarios. Nuestra abogac&iacute;a contiene trabajo con medicamentos que cargamos (que no est&aacute;n aprobados) y los que y&aacute; est&aacute;n aprobados o est&aacute;n al bordo de aprobaci&oacute;n. Ejemplos de ambas categorias son: albendazole para microsporidiosis, thalidomide para el desgasto f&iacute;sico y &uacute;lceras aphthosas, nitazoxanide (NTZ) para criptosporidiosis, topotecan, un tratamiento pos&iacute;ble para PML, una infecci&oacute;n desabilidora del cerebro, y Crixivan (Indinavir), el inhibidor de proteasa de Merck. En nuestra abogac&iacute;a nos ligamos con otros organizaciones de SIDA locales, nacionales y internacionales, y solicitamos con frecuencia el participaci&oacute;n de la gente que lee el bolet&iacute;n y que compra los medicamentos.</p>

<p>El Health Group est&aacute; entregado a empoderimiento y apoya las decisiones de tratamiento de los personas viviendo con VIH/SIDA y sus medicos. El acceso a informaci&oacute;n es mano-a-mano al acceso a medicamentos. Aqu&iacute; es donde este bolet&iacute;n hace su trabajo. Examinamos los datos de tratamientos prometadores, aprobados y no aprobados, y creamos hojas de datos, cartas y articulos en la manera m&aacute;s clara y accesible posible. En esta edici&oacute;n de Notas tenemos: versiones de nuestras hojas de datos (Una Hojeada a los Inhibidores de Proteasa, Hay M&aacute;s en la Vida que AZT); informaciones de las maneras de obtener medicamentos gratis por programas de ‘uso compasivo’ y ‘acceso extendido’; un reporte de regimes nuevos para tratar y prevenir MAC; y m&aacute;s informaci&oacute;n interesante y &uacute;til. </p>

<p>M&iacute;ralo y d&iacute;nos lo que le ayuda. Venga a la oficina y habla con nosotros. Ll&aacute;manos por tel&eacute;fono, fax o email con las preguntas, avisos, criticas o lo que quiera. Nuestro trabajo es escuchar a lo que necesita-en t&eacute;rminos de tratamientos e informacion. Entonces, bienvenido. Y finalmente, ay&uacute;danos hacer nuestro trabajo lo mejor posible.</p>

<p><b><a name="Lista">Una</a> Lista de Programas de 'Uso Compasivo' y 'Acceso Extendido'</b></p>

<p>El ‘uso compasivo’ y ‘acceso extendido’ son frases casi intercambiables, usados para describir una manera a recebir medicamentos de gratis de las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as farmac&eacute;uticas Muchas compa&ntilde;&iacute;as organizan estos tipos de programas por compasi&oacute;n, pero es m&aacute;s probable que est&eacute;n buscando una parte del mercado. Presi&oacute;n de las personas viviendo con SIDA y activistas contra las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as y el FDA resulta frecuentemente en que las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as farmac&eacute;uticas le ofrezcan el medicamento a un grupo de pacientes sin costo alguno. De vez en cuando el FDA deja que la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a cobre el medicamento, un asunto siempre f&eacute;o.</p>

<p>Medicamentos ofrecidos por un programa de este tipo no son aprobados por el FDA, por eso las pacientes no son reembolsadas por las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as de seguros o medicaid. Un programa de este tipo existe hasta el momento que el FDA aprueba el medicamento. A veces el programa queda abierto para que la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a pueda colectar m&aacute;s datos o porque un grupo grande de pacientes tiene problemas con los seguros o reembolso. La siguiente es una lista de medicamentos que las personas viviendo con SIDA pueden obtener, la indicaci&oacute;n para tratamiento, las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as que apoyan los programas y los n&uacute;meros de tel&eacute;fono necesarios.</p>

<p><b><a name="inhibidores">Hay</a> M&aacute;s en la Vida que AZT: Una Introduci&oacute;n a los Inhibidores de Protease</b></p>

<p><b>&#191;Qu&eacute; es un inhibidor de proteasa?</b><br>
Inhibidores de proteasa son un grupo de medicamentos nuevos. Luchan contra el virus VIH directamente. Algunas de ellas son aprobadas y algunas todav&iacute;a son experimentales. Hay alrededor de 20 inhibidores de proteasa diferentes que est&aacute;n siendo estudiados. Tienen fuerzas diferentes. Algunos est&aacute;n aprobados o est&aacute;n cercando aprobaci&oacute;n.</p>

<p><b>&#191;C&oacute;mo hacen lo que hacen?</b><br>
El virus VIH necesita reproduzirse much&iacute;simo para hacerle da&ntilde;o a Ud. Esto tiene muchas etapas y la enzima prote&aacute;sa tiene una funci&oacute;n important&iacute;sima en una de las etapas. VIH necesita esta enzima para produzir c&oacute;pias de si misma. Estos medicamentos paran la enzima proteasa.</p>

<p><b>&#191;Son estos inhibidores como AZT?</b><br>
No. AZT (Retrovir), ddI (Videx), ddC (Hivid), d4T (Stavudine) y 3TC (Epivir) son una clase diferente de medicamentos. Se llaman an&aacute;logos de n&uacute;cleoside. Trabajan contra el VIH parando una enzima diferente llamada transciptase reverso. Medicamentos como AZT funcionan bien con algunas personas, pero no con todo el mundo.</p>

<P><b>&#191;P&oacute;rque no?</b> Primero, medicamentos como AZT no son especificos. Atacan muchas c&eacute;lulas blancas incluso las que no tienan VIH. Segundo, medicamentos como AZT pueden causar efectos secundarios muy graves. Tercero, los efectos positivos duran solamente 6 &aacute; 12 meses para la mayor&iacute;a de personas.</p>

<p><b>&#191;Qu&eacute; m&aacute;s?</b> Medicamentos como AZT no son tan fuerte contra el VIH como algunos de los inhibidores de proteasa. Tambi&eacute;n, las drogas como AZT solamente protejen c&eacute;lulas blancas que no est&aacute;n infectadas. Luchan contra el VIH que y&aacute; est&aacute; dentro de la c&eacute;lula. Inhibidores de proteesa pueden entrar en c&eacute;lulas infectadas y parar la producci&oacute;n del VIH. </p>

<p>Hasta ahora los inhibidores de proteasa parecen muchos m&aacute;s seguro que el AZT y otros an&aacute;logos de n&uacute;cleoside. Son tan especificas que no da&ntilde;an su m&eacute;dula de hueso u otras c&eacute;lulas blancas en su sangre, pero no hay datos sobre la seguridad de usarlas por mucho tiempo.</p>

<p><b>&#191;Hay problemas con los inhibadores de proteasa?</b><br>
S&iacute;. Uno de los grandes problemas con los inhibidores de proteasa es lo mismo que se me olvid&oacute; contarles con respecto a los an&aacute;logos de nucleoside. Con todos los medicamentos que combaten al VIH, como AZT o 3TC o los inhibidores de proteasa, un grande problema puede ser la resistencia contra el medicamento. Resistencia ocurre cuando el VIH aprende a seguir reproduciendo a pesar de la presencia de un medicamento. Cuando el VIH es resistente al medicamento, este medicamento no puede combatir el VIH. </p>

<p>La resistencia contra los medicamentos es un problema grande con todos estos medicamentos. Por ejemplo, si tu VIH aprende a evitar el AZT, Ud. puede (si quiere) cambiar al ddI. Probablemente esto no es el caso con los inhibidores de proteasa. Tomando un inhibador de proteasa puede cambiar el VIH en su cuerpo hasta que no funcione ningun otro inhibador de proteasa. &Eacute;sto se llama resistencia cruzada. Desafortunadamente, parece que todos de los inhibidores de proteasa puedan causar resistencia cruzada, aunque no necesariamente sucere al nivel individuo. Cada caso es diferente.</p>

<p><b>&#191;Se puede parar la resistencia contra los medicamentos?</b><br>
El virus VIH es muy intelegente y puede aprender a resitir muchos de los medicamentos. Sin embargo, nosotros esperamos que combinando medicamentos (tomando m&aacute;s que un medicamento anti-VIH a la vez), confunda el VIH. Cuando medicamentos se combinan, el VIH tiene m&aacute;s dificultad aprendiendo evitar los medicamentos. Si una combinaci&oacute;n no para la resistencia contra el medicamento, talvez ser&aacute; m&aacute;s despacio. </p>

<p>Algunos m&eacute;dicos creen que los inhibadores de proteasa deben ser tomadas con medicamentos como AZT y 3TC para posponer la resistencia. Nosotros no tenemos ninguna idea como &eacute;sta funciona. Esperamos que las pruebas clinicas que estudian estas combinaciones de medicamentos nos informar&aacute;n m&aacute;s.</p>

<p><b>&#191;Hay algunos efectos secundarios al tomar los inhibidores de proteasa?</b><br>
Como tantas cosas que parecen ayudarnos luchar contra el VIH, hay efectos secundarios de las inhibidoras de prote&aacute;sa. </p>

<p>Primero, se necesita tomar mucho del medicamento para que funcione. El cuerpo no puede absorber los inhibidores facilmente. El tomar mucho de cualquier medicamento representa peligro para el h&iacute;gado, los ri&ntilde;ones y el est&oacute;mago. En tomar m&aacute;s y m&aacute;s de los medicamentos de tipos varios el trabajo del h&iacute;gado para derribarlos aumenta y causa problemas f&iacute;sicas. </p>

<p>Segundo, hay bastante medicamentos que no se permiten junto al inhibidor, dependiente en el inhibador Ud. decide tomar. Estos incluyen: Rifampin, Rifabutin, Prozac y Seldane. Se reportan efectos secundarios como dolor de cabeza, diarr&eacute;a de breve duraci&oacute;n, mal est&oacute;mago, salpullidos, raramente piedras del ri&ntilde;on y problemas de la presi&oacute;n.</p>

<p><b><a name="norvir">Propuestas</a> para Iniciar Terapia con Norvir</b><br>
Norvir, el inhibidor de proteasa de Abbott, fue aprobada, a la dosis de 600mg bid (2 veces por d&iacute;a), baseada en una prueba cl&iacute;nica que mostr&oacute; un benef&iacute;cio en supervivencia con personas viviendo con SIDA de menos de 100 CD4. Ahora, Abbott nos avisa tomar una dosis peque&ntilde;a al empezar y aumentar la dosis a trav&eacute;s de varios dias, subiendo a la dosis regular al llegar al d&iacute;a catorceno. &Eacute;sto diminuye los efectos secundarios comunes: diarr&eacute;a, v&oacute;mito, entumecimiento y hincha.</p>

<p><b>&#191;Cu&aacute;l importancia tiene la dosis inicial? </b><br>
No sabemos si empezar con una dosis menor diminuye los efectos de Norvir. Todav&iacute;a no se h&aacute; estudiada. Las dosis m&aacute;s bajas fueron mejores toleradas en las pruebas clinicas. Hay raz&oacute;n para ser cauto: varias veces durante el proceso de aprobaci&oacute;n la compa&ntilde;ia nos dijo que su forma nueva de c&aacute;psula fue tolerada mejor que la forma l&iacute;quida original. No nos ofreci&oacute; ningunos datos a probarse e ignor&oacute; que 30% de los pacientes retiraron de la prueba francesa de c&aacute;psulas.</p>

<p>No sabemos si subir la dosis gradualmente ofrezca el benficio m&aacute;ximo de Norvir o c&oacute;mo el subir afectar&aacute; la resistencia del VIH contra los inhibadores de proteasa. El h&iacute;gado le toma un tiempo ‘aprender’ a procesar Norvir. As&iacute; es que durante los primeros 3-4 dias, los niveles de Norvir en la sangre son m&aacute;s altos que cualquier otro tiempo. Por el d&iacute;a catorce, el h&iacute;gado aprende a procesar un nivel plano del medicamento. Tomar la dosis de 600 mg bid resultar&iacute;a en una carga m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;a del medicamento activo en la sangre que previamente. &Eacute;sto es importante porque ahora mismo no sabemos si cargar un nivel alto en los dias principios trae provecho o no tiene efecto.</p>

<p>En la prueba de Abbott, todo el mundo tom&oacute; los 600mg bid prescritos, as&iacute; es que todos en la prueba empezaron con una explosi&oacute;n intensa de medicamento &aacute;ctiva. Dentro de 10 dias, una diferencia significante se mostr&oacute; entre el grupo que tom&oacute; Norvir y el que no tom&oacute; en supervivencia e infecciones oportunistas nuevas. La diferencia culmen&oacute; en la semana 4 y permaneci&oacute; por los siguientes 5 meses constante. Los scientificos de Abbott argumentan el beneficio en supervivencia transcurri&oacute; a causa de la llegada, por el d&iacute;a catorce, de la supresi&oacute;n promedia de la carga viral. Nos dicen que el subir la dosis gradualmente nos d&aacute; una supresi&oacute;n de la carga viral equivalente, as&iacute; es que todo debe estar bien. Esta prueba no nos d&aacute; ninguna respuesta. No sabremos ahora o en el futuro porque Abbott no tiene ningunos planes de hacer una comparasi&oacute;n de escalaci&oacute;n de dosis contra dosis regular. &#161;Qu&eacute; sorpreza!</p>

<p><b>&#191;Qu&eacute; fue estudiado?</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Pruebas clinicas de fase II/III: pacientes empezaron tomando 600 mg bid y continuaron con la misma durante toda la prueba. 
<p>
<li>Pruebas clinicas de fase I (dosis variadas): Norvir tiene una ‘ventana terap&eacute;utica’ bien peque&ntilde;a. Para obtener el benef&iacute;cio m&aacute;ximo del medicamento no hay muchas variaciones en como tomarlo. 400mg bid no mostr&oacute; un benef&iacute;cio clinico significante y m&aacute;s de 600mg no fue tolerado por los pacientes. Con todas de las dosis, algunas personas sufrieron diarr&eacute;a, v&oacute;mito, entumecimiento y hincha.
</ol>

<p><b>Las recomendaciones del momento de Abbott </b><br>
Las instrucciones en el paquete recomendan usar 5 dias para llegar a la dosis completa: D&iacute;a 1-300mg bid; dias 2 y 3-400mg bid; d&iacute;a 4-500mg bid; d&iacute;a 6 y despues-600mg bid. </p>

<p>En la pr&oacute;xima prueba, nos sugeren a llegar en 7 dias a la dosis completa: Dias 1 y 2-300mg bid; dias 3 y 4-400mg bid; dias 5 y 6-500mg bid; d&iacute;a 7 y despues-600mg bid Y si problemas del est&oacute;mago le permanezcan, diminuya de nuevo a una dosis de 500mg bid (ve Ud. abajo). </p>

<p>En reuniones los cient&iacute;ficos nos recomieron usar 14 dias para llegar a la dosis completa: Dias 1 y 2- 300mg bid; dias 3 y 4-400mg bid; dias 5 &aacute; 13-500mg bid; d&iacute;a y despues 14-600mg bid Tiene que llegar al 600mg bid por el d&iacute;a 14 de tratamiento. </p>

<p>Despues de este punto las instrucciones se obfuscan: «Si no puede tolerar a los 600mg bid, puede mantenerse con 500mg bid.» La dosis de 500mg no es la dosis aprobada. En estudios de dosis variada, 500mg bid tuvieron un efecto menos sostenido en la carga viral y las celulas CD4. </p>

<p>Entonces, &#191;qu&eacute; recado? Conta la carga viral, hable con su m&eacute;dico, talvez toma 600 mg bid d&iacute;a primero para saber si puede tolerar (mucha gente puede) y si no puede tolerarlo, toma a la dosis entera por el d&iacute;a catorce.</p>

<p><b><a name="mac">Dale</a> un Macanazo a MAC</b><br>
<i>por Andy Young</i></p>

<p>El reevuelo de proteasa al lado, la Conferencia Retroviral en febrero di&oacute; a personas viviendo con VIH/SIDA y sus medicos muchas informaciones de la prevenci&oacute;n de MAC (mycobacterium avium). MAC es una infecci&oacute;n bacterial que causa una variedad de s&iacute;ntomas y es dif&iacute;cil a diagnosticar. Con frecuencia la gente con la infecci&oacute;n tiene fiebres, una falta de apetito, y la bacteria puede presentarse en casi todas las partes del cuerpo. Dos pruebas clinicas se contrastaron unos tratamientos y regimes de prevenci&oacute;n. Estas pruebas son importantes porque la gente con menos de 100 CD4 usan Rifabutin como la prevenci&oacute;n primaria contra MAC, y se tiene que terminar de usar o cambiar la dosis cuando se use con los inhibadores de proteasa. Ahora mismo Rifabutin es el &uacute;nico medicamento aprobada para la prevenci&oacute;n de MAC. En una prueba, 1200 pacientes con menos de 100 CD4 tomaran Rifabutin, Clarithromycin o los dos. La otra contrast&oacute; los 669 pacientes con Rifabutin, Azithromycin o los dos en combinaci&oacute;n.</p>

<p>En el estudio primero, 9% de los pacientes que tomaran Clarithromycin desarrollaron MAC, 15% con Rifabutin y 7% de la combinaci&oacute;n...no son diferencias tan grandes. Lo importante es que casi 30% de la gente usando Clarithromycin sali&oacute; con resistencia al medicamento. Clarithromycin es el medicamento corriente para tratar una infecci&oacute;n activa de MAC. Entonces el desarrollo de resistencia a los medicamentos antes de enfermarse con MAC da not&iacute;cia mal&iacute;sima.</p>

<p>En el estudio segundo, la combinaci&oacute;n mostr&oacute; ser el mejor tratamiento preventativo de nuevo. Un 2.5% de los pacientes que tomaron Azithromycin y Rifabutin desarrollaron la MAC, en contraste al 8.8% que us&oacute; Azithromycin s&oacute;lo y el 11.6% que tomaron Rifabutin. Lo soztoso es que 11% de la gente quienes desarrollaron MAC en el estudio salieron resistente a ambos Azithromycin y Clarithromycin. La raz&oacute;n es en la estuctura qu&iacute;mica que es similar en las dos drogas; resistencia a uno funcionalmente es resistencia a los dos. La resistencia cruzada entre Azithromycin y Clarithromycin dejar&aacute; solamente Rifabutin como el tratamiento &uacute;nico para una infecci&oacute;n de MAC.</p>

<p>Estos estudios nos dicen que hay m&aacute;s, y posiblemente m&aacute;s eficazes maneras de prevenir MAC que entendimos en el pasado. El uso con buen &eacute;xito de Azithromycin es muy interesante porque se toma solamente una vez por semana, en comparaci&oacute;n a todos los dias con los otros. Un problema potencial fuere resistencia cruzada entre Azithromycin y Clarithromycin, adem&aacute;s cuando pensamos de tratar una infecci&oacute;n de MAC. La gente no desarrolla una resistencia a Rifabutin por tomar, o de los otros medicamentos discutidos aqu&iacute;, pero Rifabutin se mostr&oacute; en las pruebas cl&iacute;nicas a ser lo peor en prevenir una infecci&oacute;n de MAC.</p>

<p>Cosa al lado, Roxithromycin, lo vendemos aqu&iacute;, importado de Alemania, es otro antibi&oacute;tico de la misma familia de Azithromycin y Clarithromycin, que se ha mostrado como un preventivo a MAC y como un tratamiento para el criptosporidio. Tratamiento y prevenci&oacute;n de MAC es una proposici&oacute;n delicada. Todos de los medicamentos son fuertes y puedan ser dif&iacute;cil a tomar, a causa de los efectos secundarios y porque el uso cambia la capacidad de tomar otros medicamentos seguramente. Prefiero que mi medico trabaje conmigo para decidir cuales medicamentos usar&eacute; a no tener ninguna opci&oacute;n .</p>

<i>por Lorna Gottesman</i></p>

<p>Me llamo Lorna Gottesman y yo soy la coordinadora del Proyecto Tratamiento de Mujeres del PWA Health Group.</p>
<p>
Los tratamientos para VIH puede confusar y optar por un tratamiento diferente puede estar abrumador, especialmente para mujeres. Muchas de nosotras no tenemos relaciones buenas con los medicos, lo que contribuye a la falta de conecemiento de los riesgos de VIH y las decesiones que tenemos que hacer cuando estamos seropositivas. M&aacute;s una cosa es que con frecuencia nosotras ponemos nuestras necesidades por detr&aacute;s de las necesidades de nuestras familias.</p>

<p>Entonces creamos el Proyecto para dar a mujeres viviendo con a mujeres viviendo con VIH/SIDA informaciones practicas sobre tratamientos, para ser una asistencia en el hacer de las decisiones de tratamientos.</p>

<p>El Proyecto ha ayudado en la organizaci&oacute;n de foros de tratamiento para mujeres en agencias diferentes en toda la ciudad de New York. Estes foros publicos consisten usualmente de un proveedor de cuidado y una mujer viviendo con VIH que discuten informacion en una manera acesible y clara.</p>

<p>Tenemos tambien una grupa para mujeres que reunen para discutir opciones en tratamientos cada semana, medicamentos que tomamos y tratamientos usadas para combatir infecciones oportunistas. Decidimos juntas en los asuntos y invitamos expertos para educar y ayudar en la formaci&oacute;n de la conversaci&oacute;n.</p>

<p>En el 22 de junio, presentamos una conferencia de un d&iacute;a que discuta tratamientos para mujeres y queremos que la conferencia se pondr&aacute;n un evento anual.. La conferencia, como todo de los servicios del Health Group, es de gratis para mujeres positivas.</p>

<b>Description</b>: Part of fighting AIDS is clearly 
understanding your choices in diet and understanding the effects on your body of the foods you eat. Equally important is your awareness of the high rate of nutrient deficiencies and the resulting high need for nutrient supplementation. MUST READ: Positively Well: Living with HIV as a Chronic, Manageable, Survivable Disease by Lark Lands: Available late summer! Order: 1-800-542-8102, Toronto: 905-672-7470. The subtitle tells it: A practical guide to nutrition, drugs and therapeutic agents, energy therapies, psychoimmunity, and hope! You need this book!! If it ever comes out, which I fear it may never. Malnutrition occurs early in HIV infection (see J Physicians Assoc AIDS Care. 1995 2(1):12 5 and J Am Diet Assoc 1994 94(9):1018 22). There is a requirement for an increased intake of both nutrients and calories. Higher protein/complex carbohydrate/fiber diets are encouraged, keeping fat to no more than 25% of the diet. If an appropriate diet is not followed and nutrients are not supplied at adequate levels, the result can be diarrhea, weight loss, and wasting. This can kill and is independent of T-cell count, antiviral medication, or presence of an OI (see Index 2, CLIN/IATRO, Weight Loss or Wasting for discussion of these). The following list provides general dietary supplementation information. While whole foods are an important base, even a good diet will not provide the levels of nutrients needed for an optimal approach. Starting early with a nutrient supplementation program (preferably immediately upon diagnosis) is highly advisable. Several studies suggest such intervention can delay progression. Nutrition is NOT "alternative" medicine; it is a fundamental component of medical care; see Being Alive, 5/95. In addition to the deficiencies in many vitamins/micronutrients, the resting energy expenditure of people with HIV is elevated–i.e., more energy is being burned even while one is just resting (see J Assn of Nurses in AIDS Care (11/94 12/94) 5(6):30). This underscores the fact that people with HIV need to take in a LOT more calories, preferably from complex carbohydrates and definitely not from fat!     While additional research is desperately needed, there is already significiant evidence for deficiencies in people with HIV (PWHIV) as well as very significant evidence that intervening with diet changes and supplementation can have very beneficial effects. Even in those with higher CD4 counts/asymptomatic, progressive deficiencies have been found in vitamins A, B6, C, E, B12, folic acid, selenium, zinc, and beta-carotene, both in adults and children. In people with lower CD4 counts/OI's, "nearly every specific nutrient is deficient." [!] Beach RS & Lefkowitz M. Nutritional aspects of HIV infection; PAACNOTES 1(6):221-223, Nov./Dec., 1989. In Jan 94, several AIDS newsletters reported on nutritional and complementary ("alternative") approaches to AIDS, including Provincetown Positive, Issue 16; GMHC's Treatment Issues 7(11/12) and the AIDS Treatment Data Network Treatment Review #9; (<a href="../numbers.html">contact info</a>). A repeating theme is the lack of interest on the part of the establishment in this area of research and the resulting lack of data, underscoring the need for trials–preferably well-designed ones that ask the right questions!! See "Experts Emphasize Need for Nutrition Therapy in AIDS," AIDS Weekly   November 22 & 29, 1993; also, Feldman, C, "Vitamin Megadoses May Slow Onset of AIDS, Researchers Find" Nation's Health (1/94) 24(1):27; Cohan, G, "Malnutrition and HIV Disease" in 2/94 edition of Being Alive.

<p><a name="anti">antioxidants</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Many companies.  Good brands include 
Amni, Perque, Biotics, Bronson, Cardiovascular Research, Jarrow<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: These include vitamins A, C and E; beta carotene, selenium, coenzyme Q10, quercitin, bioflavonoids, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, as precursor to glutathione), and other nutrients that work either directly as antioxidants or form part of other antioxidant substances. See below for specific information on each. For more information, see my report on the pivotal and important conference on Oxidative Stress and AIDS held at NIH, 11/8-10/93.Tests: Serum vitamin levels are notoriously bad for assessing true deficiencies; often, surrogate markers may provide a clearer picture, especially when tissue levels are a better marker. For example, EGOT levels for B6 deficiency. See Lark Lands' book Positively Well for a lengthier discussion. Other markers like malondialdehyde and clastogenic plasma factor (DNA damaging material) may also test the degree of oxidative stress. The thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances test (TBARS) is another; sudden increases in this number were correlated with the development of OIs, particularly toxoplasmosis; however, this test needs more confirmation and may not be readily available.</p>

<p><a name="acid">acidophilis</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Natren, Jarrow, Kyodophilus, 
Maxidophilus, Perquedophilus<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Necessary bacteria that should be used when taking any antibiotics (which destroy the intestinal bacterial that provide the body's natural supply) or if you have candida (indicating an insufficient level of good bacteria to prevent candida overgrowth) or diarrhea. These good bacteria produce thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folic acid, choline, biotin, and vitamin K. A deficiency of these good bacteria can cause deficiencies of these nutrients and can be one cause of diarrhea. Recent research suggests that they may also help to prevent infections like MAC or cryptosporidiosis or CMV from taking hold in the intestines, both by competing for space with the pathogens in a way that keeps the pathogens from colonizing the intestines and also by producing natural antibiotics and antiparasiticals; see Harp J, Chen W, and Harmsen A. Resistance of severe combined immunodeficient mice to infection with Cryptosporidium parvum: the importance of intestinal microflora. Infection and Immunity 60(9):3509-3512, 1992. Request Natren's "Patient Guide" to what they call "probiotic" products (i.e., acidophilus and other microorganisms); 800-992-3323 or 805-371-4737. Also, definitely see discussion in Lark Lands Positively Well.</p>

<p><a name="beta">beta carotene</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 25,000-150,000 IU's/day. Water-soluble precursor of Vit A–it cleaves in half when the body needs it to form two molecules of Vit A; anti-cancer. Accutane (an artificial form), improves CD4+ counts and NK activity; unfortunately, benefits may wain after 3 mos (at 60mg/day)–see J. of Nutrition, March 1992;122(3):728-732. Several articles in Proc. of the Nutrition Soc., (1991)50. See also Coodley, GO, et al.,  alpha-carotene in HIV infection, JAIDS, (1993) 6:272-276. Hoffmann La Roche: Nutritional aspects of ambulatory care: vitamins and the immune response, Document: RCD 5265. There are many types of carotenes found in various foods: carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and winter squash    alpha- &  beta-carotene; green leafy vegetables   lutein (and beta carotene); tomatoes and watermelon   lycopene (and gamma carotene for tomatoes); citrus fruits   beta cryptoxanthin; corn and peaches   zeaxanthin; salmon and certain seafood   astaxanthin. In general, go for dark green, orange, yellow, and red fruits and vegetables. Note: IU (International Units) is the term usually used for vitamin A amounts; for beta carotene, 15 mg is equivalent to 25,000 IU. </p>

<p><a name="biotin">biotin</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>:Amni, Cardiovascular Research, Nature’s Way, Solgar; many<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 10-15 mg/day. Normally produced by intestinal bacteria which are destroyed in anyone on antibiotics. Not much in food so supplementation necessary. Helps prevent candida problems. Helps metabolize fatty acids, and thus is critical for fat digestion; also necessary for amino acid metabolism. Biotin deficiency can cause dementia; shown in kidney dialysis patients on biotin-free restricted diets; such neurological problems reversed with a couple of months of biotin supps. May also help reverse neuropathy, both peripheral (cause of numbness and pain in feet, legs, hands, arms) and autonomic (contributor or cause of impotency and digestive problems). For neuropathy, works best when used in doses of 15-20 mg/day (15,000-20,000 mcg) and in combination with choline, inositol, B6, B12, and thiamine. See Lark Lands' Positively Well, Treatments for Neuropathy. (Aside: good for cats with flea-bite induced allergies and skin problems; sprinkle 1000 mcg in their food daily; scratching themselves stops; scabs disappear; cats are happy.)</p>

<p><a name="calcium">calcium</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Biotics, Perque<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 1000 mg/day at supper. Take your magnesium at breakfast, which balances the calcium.</p>

<p><a name="carnitine">carnitine</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Cardiovascular Research; Carnitor<br>
<b>Availability</b>: prescription, over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: A critical amino acid necessary for fat metabolism; levels decline as HIV disease progresses; lack can cause internal decline and wasting. Use 250-1500 mg/3-4 times per day on an empty stomach. It provides energy by transporting long chain fatty acids to mitochondria to act as fuel. One study showed reductions in high levels of TNF-alpha, triglycerides and  ß2M (6 g/day for 2 weeks). Reduces AZT-myopathy by limiting damage to microtubules (see Lab Invest 1994 Jul;71(1):102 12; see also Immunopharmacology and Immunotoxicology  15(1):1-12, 1993; De Simone C, et al. L-carnitine deficiency in AIDS. AIDS 6(2):203-205, 1992.) See CLINICAL/IATRO, myopathy. See discussion in Lark Lands' Positively Well, Chapter Two, The Core Approach; very important! Note: Expensive in the higher doses often needed; Rx form Carnitor available; depending on your insurance coverage, might save you money (although it's MUCH more expensive if you're paying out of pocket.)</p>

<p><a name="choline">choline</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various; Cardiovascular Research<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 1000 mg/2x/day choline citrate. Improves nerve and immune function. May help reverse neuropathy, both peripheral and autonomic; higher doses may be needed, up to 1000-3000 mg of phosphatidylcholine, 3 times per day; see discussion under Biotin; Cardiovascular Research has good inositol/choline mixture in their "Supercholine."</p>

<p><a name="coq">CoEnzyme Q (10Ubiquinone)</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Biotics,Jarrow,  NutraMax<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 30-300 mg/day with meals. Improves basal cell energy, oxygenation of cells; good for PWAs w/low levels in heart, cardiomyopathy or periodontal disease; may help prevent or reverse congestive heart failure; reverses cardiotoxic effect of adriamycin. Good for fatigue, adenopathy. May help prevent progression. Study suggests that people with HIV are deficient in a progressive fashion (see Folkers, K et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1988 153(2):888-96). Unfortunately: it ain't cheap! Receptagen filed a patent on use of CoQ10 to inhibit apoptosis (contact Clive Woodhouse, Ph.D., Director of Research and Product Development of Receptagen Corp., 206 778 5260.</p>

<p><a name="copper">copper</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Allergy Research Group, Cardio Res.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 2-4 mg/day. Zinc in morning, copper in evening (they balance each other). Deficiency prevents normal response of the scavenger cells to infection; supplementation may interfere with zinc uptake if taken at same meal; see Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci., (1992) 89:6794-6797. Possible faster progression seen in one trial in people with higher zinc intake may be either (a) a statistical anomaly or (b) due to lack of copper balance. If you take an iron supplement, take it at the same time as the copper.</p>

<p><a name="dmg">dimethylglycine (DMG)</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: DaVinci, Biotics<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Dosage depends on AZT. Oxygenates cells and increases energy. 100-200mg/day with each meal.</p>

<p><a name="folic">folic acid/folate/folinic acid</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various; Biotics<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Take with Vitamin B12. 1000 mcg/day; folic acid deficiency can result in megaloblastic anemia (badly formed red blood cells). Folic acid is necessary for proper hematopoeisis (development of stem cells). Folic acid deficiency may increase the susceptibility to anal or cervical dysplasia or cancer. In HIV-neg women, study has shown reversal of cervical dysplasia with doses of 5 mg (5000 mcg) per day; anal tissue is similar so may also help there. See important discussion in Lark Lands' Positively Well. For clarity: folic acid or folate are natural; folinic acid is the synthetic version. Folacin is an older name for folic acid. Folic acid is a water soluble vitamin (pteoric acid linked to L-glutamic acid). Folinic acid is also known as leucovorin or citrovorum factor.</p>

<p><a name="glutamine">glutamine</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: <br>
<b>Availability</b>: experimental<br>
<b>Description</b>: Very important addition to TPN; helps repair 
the gut and soothe intestines when diarrhea has caused damage; can add to TPN up to 8g/day, slowly raising to this level). It has helped reduce constant diarrhea to an intermittent level in some; used for those undergoing radiation.</p>

<p><a name="inositol">inositol</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 500 mg/2x/day. Improves nerve function; taken with choline and biotin, some have found improvements in HIV-induced neuropathy at doses of 1000-4000 mg/day; see Biotin; Cardiovascular Research has good inositol/choline mixture in their "Supercholine."</p>

<p><a name="iodine">iodine</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Deficiency may result in thyroid problems. Diet or multivitamin should provide sufficient iodine.</p>

<p><a name="iron">iron (Ferrous sulfate, Hematin)</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Perque, Cardiovascular Research, SmithKline<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: use separate form (not in multi-vitamin as it oxidize other minerals). Deficiency produces impaired bacterial killing ability, possible T-cell decrease; too much (>100mg/day) can increase bacterial virulence. Take w/copper for better absorption. The SmithKline product, however, (and this is in the PDR!) is manufactured with ozone depleting methylchloroform which may cause global warming, increased risk of skin cancer; since they're so mean, use someone else's product! Doxycycline with iron results in decreased doxy absorption; use with cimetidine (Tagamet) may result in decreased iron effect; decreased iron effect also in kids with vitamin E.</p>

<p><a name="lauric">lauric acid (Monolaurin)</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Cardiovascular Research<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Lauric acid is an essential fatty acid shown to kill lipid-enveloped viruses (like herpes and maybe HIV) and many protozoa. It is found in concentrated amounts in coconut fat. Coconut cream, available in Southeast Asian markets, is a good CHEAP source; 2 tablespoons, 3X/day, would provide amounts of lauric acid proposed by lipid expert Mary Enig, Ph.D., as probably working both against protozoal infections and HIV; salvage therapy trial for cryptosporidiosis now planned by Donald Kotler, M.D., at Columbia; as general non-toxic antiviral, Monolaurin (6-12 capsules/day on an empty stomach; take 6 at a time with big glass of water); however, note that coconut cream is much cheaper and more concentrated source of lauric acid; can be used in cooking, in soups, in supplemental drink mixtures, as spread, etc. </p>

<p><a name="lipoic">lipoic acid/thioctic acid</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various; Jarrow, Cardiovascular Research<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter, clinical trials<br>
<b>Description</b>: An antioxidant and liver protector. Lots of meds used by PWAs can damage the liver as can other infections (see Index 2, VIRUSES, Hepatitis). 1-2 with each meal may help protect liver from drug toxicity. Helps to lower liver enzymes (AST or SGOT, ALT or SGPT). "AST is generally a more sensitive indicator of chronic and infiltrative lesions while ALT is the more sensitive test in acute and obstructive liver disease" from Yanick P and Jaffe, R: Clinical Chemistry & Nutrition Guidebook. See Hepatitis, below. May also be anti-HIV.There was a combo therapy trial with AZT which showed strong anti-HIV effects in vitro; see Klin Wochenschr., (1991) 69:722-24 and anti-tat activity in Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1994 205(1):967 75. In people suggest same (Int'l Conf 1991 abstract MA.1075; 1994 Yokohama #401A, PA0336). Improvements in glutathione levels, plasma ascorbate and thiol groups and reductions in oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal seen in small (n=10), open label study (Arzneimittelforschung 1993 43(12):1359 62). </p>

<p><a name="lysine">lysine (amino acid)</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 1-3 g/day used by some to suppress herpes; however, note that the anti-herpes effect comes because lysine blocks the uptake of arginine, another amino acid that is necessary for production of human growth hormone; long-term blocking of arginine is, thus, not a good idea; HGH may be very important for preventing wasting; see Lark Lands' Positively Well for info on approach to increasing HGH via a combo therapy with lysine and arginine.</p>

<p><a name="magnesium">magnesium (magnesium glutamate)</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Amni, Allergy Research Group, Biotics<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Deficiency can cause constipation, cramping, worsening of PMS symptoms, neuropathy and thymic hyperplasia. For constipation, 750-1000 mg/day. Used up in AZT breakdown. Take in morning (calcium at supper since they compete for absorption). Magnesium used with aminoglycosides results in increased neuromuscular blockade (a problem).</p>

<p><a name="methionine">methionine (amino acid)</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Livron, various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Required for building the body's antioxidant defense molecules; may be very beneficial for myelopathy which is a crippling nerve disorder. Study under way at Mt. Sinai, NYC (see Index 2, NEUROLOGICAL).</p>

<p><a name="molyb">molybdenum</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 50-150  g/day. A must for ddI users since it's used up when the drug is broken down; resulting deficiency could result in sulfite sensitivity and subsequent severe (possibly life threatening) allergic reactions.</p>

<p><a name="multiple">multiple vitamins*</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Perque is excellent brand; many others available but often don't have best forms of vits/mins or don't include critical ones.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: From Lark Lands' Positively Well: "A supplement program should always have as its base a hypoallergenic, very bioavailable multiple vitamin and mineral that will supply a basic level of all the nutrients most important to human function in a form likely to be taken up by those suffering from the absorption problems of HIV infection. A good, high-potency multiple makes up for overall dietary deficiencies and helps maintain nutritional balance when you are taking other nutrients separately. This type of supplement will provide a balanced supply of nutrients in appropriate ratios for normal function. However, please remember that you are not dealing here with normal function. With all the factors that result in the advanced deficiencies that have been found in most of those living with this disease, it is almost always necessary to add to the multiple a number of additional supplements both to increase dosage levels and to include those things often not found in multiples. . . For the best absorption and metabolism, the multiple should contain very absorbable forms of minerals that are pure, easily absorbed and transported, and biologically active, including citrates, fumarates, malates, aspartates, ascorbates, picolinates, and those from vegetable culture sources, rather than in the form of gluconates (the most common, cheapest, and least absorbable forms); examples include zinc picolinate and calcium citrate. In addition, the multiple vitamin should include advanced forms of the B vitamins, such as B 6 in the form of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate rather than pyridoxine alone, vitamin B2 in the form of riboflavin-5'-phosphate instead of just riboflavin, and so on. Most formulas would require taking 2-4 capsules or tablets per day with meals for an optimal dose (check specifics for the one you're taking). Because of the water-soluble nature of some nutrients that results in quick loss from the body, the best formulas will be designed such that you take one or two with each meal or at least one with breakfast and with dinner."</p>

<p><a name="octa">octacosanol</a><br>

Omega-3 found in marine lipid concentrate formulation (MaxEPA (eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids) 300-600 mg/day).  Omega-6 includes gamma-linolenic acid (found in evening primrose oil, borage oil, grape seed oil; 240mg-720 mg/day). See NEJM (1989) 320:265-271; Good discussion on fatty acids in Lark Lands' Positively Well. Can really help eliminate dry, itchy skin that drives people nuts!</p>

<p><a name="paba">PABA (a B vitamin)</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>:<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Para-aminobenzoic acid. Protects against damage to lungs done by ozone. (Less ozone high in the atmosphere causes bad sunburn; too much at street level is bad for the lungs); also provides some protection against radiation damage from sun or radiation therapy. PABA with pyrimethamine (Daraprim) may decrease pyrimethamine effect against toxoplasmosis.</p>

<p><a name="selenium">selenium</a>*<br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Biotics, Nutramax<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Dexription</b>: Minimum 150-200 micrograms/day; maximum 800-1000 mcg/day (600-800 is probably optimal because of high oxidative stress of HIV disease). Better w/<a href="#vite">Vit. E</a>. Inorganic (selenate or selenite) forms are probably best. Will Taylor suggests selenium deficiency may be important in pathogenesis; he derives the ideas from comparisons of genetic requirements of viruses (see J Med Chem 1994, 37:2637 2654). Suppose it's possible that if HIV needs selenium this may in fact be "feeding the virus" but Taylor thinks this keeps virus happy so it doesn't feel need to go elsewhere in search of selenium, replicating along the way; selenium deficiency may result in more lethal viral variants (I know I get testy and nasty when I'm hungry...so maybe keeping the HIV "fat and happy" will prevent nastier variants from arising; certainly, it is apparent that people who become infected with AZT-resistant virus acquire a meaner pathogen that results in faster progression)–see Newsday article by Laurie Garrett 5/1/95 "Study: Diet Can Start Virus' Lethal Mutation." However, the study she discusses looked only at Coxsackie virus, not HIV.</p>

<p><a name="thioctic">thioctic (lipoic acid)</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Cardiovascular Research<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: See <a href="#lipoic">lipoic acid</a>.</p>

<p><a name="veg">vegetables/juicer</a><br>
<b>Description</b>: Juicers are a good idea but be very careful to thoroughly clean vegetables. If CD4s < 150, they should be peeled or dipped in boiling water for 5-10 seconds (to prevent MAC, etc.); best choice is juicer like VitaMix that retains the pulp because that's where a large percentage of the nutrients are; use all colored veggies (red, orange, yellow, dark green); but be careful with beet juice; recommended in many herb books but, boy, does it shock the liver; small amount (no more than 1/4 cup in large glass of juice) good for liver function (although don't be alarmed after you drink it if your poop is red/purple; you're not bleeding to death; it's just the beet juice!)</p>

<p><a name="vita">vitamin A</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 10,000-15,000 IU/day. Fat soluble vitamin. Helps maintain integrity of respiratory tract; high concentrations may suppress HIV replication in macrophages; regression of hairy leukoplakia seen with A; stored in fat, so high doses (usually >50,000 IU/day but everyone has individually determined tolerance) can be toxic. Important in first-line, nonspecific antimicrobial defenses. Take with your zinc supplement. Vitamin A deficiency has been correlated with HIV disease mortality; also with vertical transmission (from mother to infant) which supplementation reduces dramatically when given early on to mothers who are deficient. Vitamin A use may increase anticoagulant effect of warfarin (Coumadin).</p>

<p><a name="vitb1">vitamins B1 (thiamine)</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 100 mg/day; thiamine is important in carbohydrate metabolism, essential for normal digestion, appetite and normal functioning of nervous tissue. Lack can cause neuropathy, confusion, dementia, colitis, diarrhea, loss of appetite and serious loss can cause nervous disorders, beriberi and paralysis. Sources: whole grain cereals, peas, beans, peanuts, oranges.</p>

<p><a name="vitb2">vitamin B2 (riboflavin)</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 100 mg/day; riboflavin deficiency generally depresses primary antibody response to immunization (same with Pantothenic Acid) as well as lassitude, weakness, skin atrophy, anemia, photophobia, reddening/cracking of lips (cheilosis) and cataracts. Found eggs, liver, green veggies, lean meat, milk and wheat germ. The RDA is around 1.3-1.4 mg.</p>

<p><a name="vitb3">vitamin B-3</a> (niacin, niacinamide, nicotinamide, antipellagra vitamin)<br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 100 mg/day; to avoid the "flushing" associated with niacin, stick with niacinamide. The body needs it for tissue respiration, fat synthesis and glycolysis (sugar breakdown). GI and mental disturbances can arise from deficiency, as well as pellagra (a disease that can cause inflamed tongue (glossitis), red, scaly patches on the skin, diarrhea, anemia, ulcers and cyst development, nerve weakness, etc. RDA around 16 mg. Niacin (not other forms) may lower cholesterol/triglyceride levels.</p>

<p><a name="vitb5">vitamin B5</a> (pantothenic acid)<br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 300-1000 mg/day of calcium pantothenate. Pantothenic acid is necessary for the production of adrenal hormones and the production of energy in the body. It has been shown to increase endurance in athletes, both decreasing their oxygen use and their lactic acid buildup. It has also been shown to speed wound healing. Pantethine is the part of the pantothenic acid molecule which is a powerful free radical scavenger; 600-1200 mg/day lowers triglyceride levels in HIV-negative. </p>

<p><a name="vitb6">vitamin B6</a> (pyridoxine)*<br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Best form is pyridoxyl phosphate, 50-100 milligrams/3x/day. Other form (pyridoxine) at 50-100mg/day. Deficiency can: suppress humoral and cell-mediated immunity, delayed skin hypersensitivity, may cause lymph tissue atrophy, lowered lymphocyte counts and inflammatory response; also splenic hypoplasia and neutrophil impairment. B6 can increase IL-2 production. Important supplement as many people are deficient. Early anxiety associated with B6 deficiency in HIV+. Take WITH other B-vitamins. More if on AZT or Isoniazid (INH). Not too much (2000-4000 mg/day)–may be toxic. May be useful to protect uninfected cells from HIV (see Auslander, J, "AIDS Vitamin," Associated Press (1/14/94).</p>

<p><a name="vitb12">vitamin B12</a>*<br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Injection: hydroxocobalamin (Merit); intranasal<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: 1000-2000 mcg, 2-3 times per week or daily for those with severe deficiencies. Deficiency can cause cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, dementia, fatigue, tinnitus (ringing in ears), canker sores. Many people w/HIV are B12 deficient. Take with folic acid. Severe deficiency can result in pernicious anemia (can cause permanent nerve damage). Univ. of Miami study showed reversal of cognitive dysfunction with B12 injections. Get holo-transcobollamin II level for tissue, not just serum B12. Best form is nasal gel (1 every other day; Oral forms don't work well; best is to use Ener-B B-12 nasal gel by Nature's Bounty or do injection of hydroxocobalamin, 2000 mcg, 2-3x/wk; injection usually Rx'd as intramuscular but can be done subcutaneously (like insulin injection; just under the skin) which is less painful, easier to do yourself. See neuropathy, fatigue (CLINICAL/IATROGENIC).</p>

<p><a name="vitc">vitamin C</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: SDV, Bronson, Perque<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Dexription</b>: T-cell activator; concentrations become high in phagocytes. Anti-inflammatory. With NAC, 9X increase in antiviral effect in vitro!  Antiviral against herpes, poliomyelitis, hepatitis. With acute viral infections (flus, colds) can reduce symptom severity, shorten illness time, if and only if done at tissue saturation level. To reach this, gradually increase dose from 3-6 g/day up to the amount that causes diarrhea; then reduce to an amount 10-20% below this level; this will be your tissue saturation level; even conservative vitamin researcher Richard Beach, M.D., now recommends that everyone with HIV do tissue saturation level long-term; because of biochemical individuality and presence of other infections (bacterial, protozoal, viral, fungal) which greatly affect the level you may need, some people may need up to 100-200 grams/day! Hi-dose not recommended for pregnant women. For in-depth discussion of all aspects, see Lark Lands' Positively Well, Chapter Six, Ascorbic Acid. Hi dose vitamin C should be accompanied by other antioxidants. CPCRA has been struggling for YEARS with a beta-carotene/Vitamin C efficacy trial: now it's been stripped down to no beta-carotene and can vitamin C cause diarrhea? Answer before trial is conducted: of course it does if you take too much too fast. Certainly, this underscore the amount of crap flowing from NIH. Now that I've given them the answer, could they give me the money?  May decrease anticoagulant effect of warfarin (coumadin).</p>

<p><a name="vitd">vitamin D</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: various<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Fat soluble. Not only will too much result in build-up that can be toxic to liver, it appears to increase HIV replication in monocytes (see AIDSWeekly, 8/26/91). Widely found in dairy products. Created in skin with any sun exposure. Supplementation probably not needed. One test tube study, however, showed improvements of maturation defects seen in macrophages (POA24-0544); seen also in some, but not all, PWAs who had low serum D3 levels and high neopterin.</p>

<p><a name="vite">vitamin E</a> (various tocopherols)<br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Metagenics, Solgar, Vitalineand, after all, the source of all E: Eastman Kodak<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Antioxidant. Deficiency depresses immune response to antigens, lymphocyte proliferative response and general resistance to infection. E concentrates more in white than red blood cells. However, really large doses may inhibit immune function or bactericidal ability. 400-800 IU/day suggested of d-alpha tocopherol; dl-alpha is synthetic form that is not as useful. Other variants are the  beta, gamma, and delta. CAUTION FOR PEOPLE WITH HEMOPHILIA:  CAN DECREASE STICKINESS OF PLATELETS; FOR THOSE WITH COAGULATION FACTOR DEFICIENCY, COULD BE A PROBLEM. Don’t take with anticoagulant drugs (e.g., warfarin). Good for itchy skin but if taking more than 800 IU/day, take under physician’s care. Decreased iron response in kids taking vitamin E; take <a href="#iron">iron</a> and vitamin E separately. Good with <a href="#vitc">vitamin C</a> and <a href="#selenium">selenium</a> (which some products provide both).</p>

<p><a name="vitk">vitamin K</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Solgar; others<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Description</b>: Fat soluble vitamin associated with improved blood clotting; deficiencies marked by hemorrhage. Deficiency most often occurs in neonates, absorption disorders (ring a bell?) or during antibiotic therapy since that kills the good bacteria that normally produce it in adults. Helpful for liver function. 2 natural types, K1 and K2 (phytonadione and menaquinone, respectively). A synthetic form, K3 (menadione) also. Sources include green leafy veggies, liver, cheese, butter, egg yolk. Yum.</p>

<p><a name="water">water</a> (lots!)<br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Filtered!<br>
<b>Description</b>: Very important–6-8 glasses/day. Helps kidneys. Dehydration (from drugs, etc.) makes good conditions for viral growth. However, you MUST have purified water. In light of recent outbreaks of <a href="../../network/simple/crypto.html">cryptosporidiosis</a> caused by water supplies in the Midwest, NYC, even in the HIV-negative, this applies regardless of CD4 level; detection of MAC bacteria in municipal water supplies also frightening. BEST BET: GOOD FILTER OR FULL BOIL FOR TEN MINUTES. The expense for filters may definitely be worth it in the long run for the sake of convenience, and for ensuring complete removal of the problematic organisms, including those found in shower water. Water purifiers/filters MUST SAY that they are certified for "NSF Standard 53 Cyst Removal"; for a list of certified filters, call 800/NSF-MARK. I have a list of such brands (in my crypto file). To filter out mycobacteria, need even finer filter. Filters can be expensive; if purchasing, must consider both purchase price and the cost of replacement filters and how often they need to be replaced. Sierra Environmental Systems product called the Sierra Pure #SE-700-L seems to do the most for the least expense, especially when you consider the cartridge replacement costs over time. This filter is .4 micron in size and will remove both Cryptosporidia and Mycobacteria. Nice extra: they remind you when it's time to replace the cartridge; good for 3 years or 3000 gallons. </p>

<p><a name="wheat">wheatgrass juice</a><br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: goddess<br>
<b>Description</b>: Available at a lot of healthfood stores, this is practically pure chlorophyll (similar structure to hemoglobin but Mg instead of Fe); it is an excellent detoxifier and a regimen of three weeks will help cleanse the body. However, note that there's no way to purify the grass so best avoided if CD4s < 150 (to avoid MAC); Suppository, too. Can do 3-day liquid fast first (see physician first!)  As your body detoxifies, the first feeling is flu-like blah but this goes away.</p>

<p><a name="zinc">zinc</a>*<br>
<b>Manufacturer</b>: Biotics, Cardiovascular Research, Solgar<<br>
<b>Availability</b>: over the counter<br>
<b>Desription</b>: Zinc is extremely important to the immune system and is required for the creation of thousands of enzymes in the body, including those required for the production of DNA and RNA; it's essential for preservation of cell-mediated immunity (T cells); deficiencies can cause susceptibility to infections and white blood cell defects. It is absolutely fundamental to immune function because you can't produce immune cells, particularly CD4 cells, without it. Zinc stimulates T-cell differentiation and maturation, stabilizes cell membranes, and increases the number of circulating T cells. Deficiency causes reduced antibody responses, thymic wasting, growth retardation, poor appetite, underfunctioning sex glands, impotency, delayed wound healing, skin problems, mental lethargy, and abnormalities of taste, smell, hearing, and vision including night blindness and tinnitus (chronic ringing in the ears. Overdosing with very high amounts of 300 mg/day in non-HIV men for 6 weeks resulted in reduced lymphocyte responsiveness, although this reversed when the zinc was discontinued. If supplementing (and balancing with copper), 25-50 mg/day of zinc citrate or zinc picolinate. Zinc sulfate at 120 mg/2x/day or 60 mg elemental zinc/day resulted in increased testosterone (these were not HIV+ pts)–Netter A et al. Arch. Androl. (1981) 7:69. For best absorption, take with B6 (25 mg of pyridoxal phosphate) and beta-carotene or vitamin A; may also improve absorption if taken with Vit D3 and/or pancreatic enzyme tab. One study appeared to show increased progression w/zinc supplementation although many experts doubt the validity; may have been a statistical anomaly, or lack of copper balancing or?  Conflicts with several other large studies that have shown decreased disease progression in those with higher zinc (and other micronutrient) intake. Recent study presented at the international conference on Nutrition and AIDS in Cannes, France (April 28-29, 1995) showed very significantly reduced numbers of OIs in a group given 200 mg of zinc sulphate per day for 30 days; those given the zinc had incresed CD4 cells, increased plasma levels of zinc-bound thymulin (critical thymic hormone); frequency of OI's in the 24 months following the zinc treatment was greatly reduced in both stage 3 (1 infection in zinc-treated vs 13 infections in controls) and stage 4 (10 infections in zinc-treated vs 24 infections in controls) groups. More research is needed but, for now, the weight of evidence is in favor of zinc supplementation, so long as balanced with copper.</p></font>

<h3><p align=center>What's the buzz.......</p></h3>

<p><b>Unprotected Oral Sex-How Safe is Safe:</b>  Forty-six adults participated in a recent study to further define the clinical and epidemiologic presentation of primary HIV infection.  The study was conducted at the University of Washington.  Of those 46 adults 12 were able to identify the exact activity that lead to seroconversion.  <b>Of those 12 participants four reported having only unprotected oral-genital contact.</b></p>

<p><b>New Kid on the Block:</b> There is a new class of antiretroviral medication called Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transpcriptase Inhibitors (<a href="../network/simple/nnrtis.html">NNRTIs</a>).  The two most tested are <a href="../network/simple/nevi.html">Nevirapine</a> (which has received FDA approval) and <a href="../network/simple/dela.html">Delaverdine</a> (which is not yet FDA approved but is available through an expanded access program).  Though chemically different from nucleoside analogs like AZT, they act in a similar manner blocking the production of reverse transcriptase (a crucial enzyme HIV needs in order to co-opt a cell's DNA and make the cell into an HIV "factory").  Early trials demostrated that when used alone viral resistance developed in two to seven weeks from start of therapy.  Recent studies indicate that this is not a problem when used in combination with one or more of the nucleoside analogs.  One study using a combination of Nevirapine, AZT, and ddI demostrated a 2 log (100 fold) drop in viral load within one month.  Furthermore, the majority of trial participants showed no signs of resistance in the 10 months the study took place.  This is encouraging news, particularly for people who either cannot tolerate, find little benefit from, or have become resistance to <a href="../network/simple/protease.html">protease inhibitors</a>.</p>

<p><b>Protecting your Eyes and Kidneys:</b> <a href="../network/simple/cmv.html">CMV</a> is a virus in the herpes family that can affect any part of your body.  Most often it attacks the eyes and is known as CMV Retinitis.  Early detection and treatment of CMV Retinitis can save your vision.  Some early warning signs of CMV Retinitis are: floaters (patches of light that seem to "float" in the air), flashers (brief flashes of light), and distortion or blind spots in your field of vision.  If you are expriencing any of these symptoms please see your doctor immediately.  But don't wait for warning signs to appear before you get a screening.  It is recommended that any one with a T-cell count of under 100 have CMV Retinitis Screening done on a regular basis.  The exam is quick and painless.  The earlier CMV is detected the more effective the treatment. <a href="../network/trials/cmvret.html">Clinical trials of treatments for CMV retinitis.</a></p>

<p><b>Warning: concerning <a href="../network/access/drugs/cido.html">Cidofovir</a> (brand name - Vistide)</b> Recent reports indicate the need for close monitoring of people using this anti-CMV medication because of the possibility of severe kidney damage.  Your doctor should do blood tests for kidney functioning before and 48 hours after treatment with Cidofovir begins.  If serum creatinine level rises more than 0.3 to 0.4mg/dl over your pretreatment reading, or if 2+ proteinuria occurs, this indicates the need for dose reduction.  If serum creatinine level rises over 0.5mg/dl, or 3+ proteinuria occurs, cidofovir should be discontinued.  Cidofovir should not be used in conjunction with other medicines known to be toxic to the kidneys.  Studies indicate Cidofovir to be effective in the treatment of CMV Retinitis, however it is crucial for your doctor to closely monitor your kidney functioning while using this medication. </p>

<p><b>Report on Vitamin B12 &amp Vitamin E:</b>  Two recent studies, one from Johns Hopkins University and the other from Janeway Child Health Care Centre in Canada, indicated that low levels of vitamin B12 and E are associated with more rapid progression of HIV disease.  Dr. Tang of Johns Hopkins found an 89&#137; increase in risk of disease progression in men with low levels of B12 as opposed to those with appropriate levels.  She also noted that men with high levels of vitamin E had a 33% decrease in the risk of disease progression.  She has demostrated that vitamin E supplementation results in raising the level of the vitamin in the blood.  Additional research is needed to demostrate if supplementation with B12 will result in increased B12 in the blood.  Dr. Tang believes more research is needed to further demostrate the connection between disease progression and deficits in vitamins E, B12, and also vitamins A and B6.</p>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARDS</B></H3>
<p align=center>The voice of the community in HIV/AIDS clinical research and education.</p>

<font size=-1>

<p><br><b>WHAT IS A COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD (CAB)?</b><br>
CABs are committees made up of people, like yourself, from the community, who have an interest in increasing available HIV/AIDS education and medical research in community health centers. No particular experience, other than life experience, is needed to become a member.  People infected with HIV and care providers are invited to join.</p>

<p><b>WHAT DO CABS DO?</b><br>
CABs represent the community in making decisions about HIV/AIDS clinical research studies that may be available in your local community health center or clinic.  They discuss and give advice about what kinds of new treatments should be studied, how research studies should be conducted so that they are ethical and meet the needs of participants, and what education should be provided to the community to keep it well informed about HIV/AIDS.  CAB members receive the latest  information about new research developments in HIV/AIDS care.</p>

<p><b>WHERE AND WHEN ARE MEETINGS HELD?</b><br>
Most CABs meet every other month at local community health centers. Some special educational meetings are held in other community locations.</p>

<p><b>ABOUT THE CLINICAL DIRECTORS NETWORK (CDN)</b><br>
Founded in 1985, the Clinical Directors Network of Region II, Inc. (CDN), is a not-for-profit organization that coordinates research and educational programs for member community health centers in New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.  CDN's HIV/AIDS Program is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Community Program for Research on AIDS (CPCRA), and the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) Community Based Clinical Trials Network (CBCTN).  The HIV/AIDS Program offers clinical trials in New York City and New Jersey, based in community health centers, that aim to improve the quality of health care for HIV+ patients.</p>

<p><B>HIV/AIDS PROGRAM MISSION</B><BR>
The mission of the CDN Community Health Center HIV/AIDS Program is to provide treatment choices for HIV+/AIDS patients in community health centers, which have been recognized as being at the forefront of delivering quality health care services and support to people of color, women, injecting drug users and their partners.</P>

<p><b>RESEARCH</b><br>
CDN's HIV/AIDS Program is currently funded by three major supporters. In 1989, CDN was awarded a contract by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to conduct Community Based Clinical Trials of HIV/AIDS (The Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS--CPCRA).  This program, which serves clients in ten community health centers in New York City and New Jersey, recently received an additional grant to follow patients until September 30, 1997.  Since the start of these grants, CDN has accrued a total of 966 patients in protocols.</p>

<p>An additional contractual award comes from the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR). CDN was selected as one of the 12 units nationwide to participate in the Foundation's Community Based Trials Network (CBCTN). This three-year program began in 1995, with the first trial having begun enrollment in December.  Seven CDN sites are participating in AmFAR-funded trials.  Several patients are currently enrolled in CDN's first AmFAR clinical trial:  looking at desensitization vs. rechallenge with Trimethoprim Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for patients who have had mild reactions in the past <a href="amfar06.html">(AmFAR 06)</a>.  Screening and enrollment has begun for a Phase I/II trial looking at Hydroxyurea + ddI as antiretroviral therapy <a href="amfar07.html">(AmFAR 07)</a>.</P>

<p><b>RIKERS ISLAND PROJECT</b><br>
This program is a continuation and expansion of the linkage program that CDN established with Montefiore/Rikers Island Health Services to provide care at Community Health Centers for HIV+ individuals discharged from Rikers Island.  The current project targets HIV+ females inmates at Rikers' Rose M. Singer Facility, offering them support groups, peer education training, and linkages to health care upon their release.  Funding for this program is from the New York City Department of Corrections, with previous funding in 1994-1995 by the Design Industry Foundation for AIDS (DIFFA).</p>

<p><b>EDUCATION</b><br>
CDN also conducts a series of HIV/AIDS related clinical rounds workshops in community health centers.  Based on the surveyed needs of center staff, these workshops address such topics as HIV and pregnancy, HIV treatment options, dental health for the HIV infected individual, and HIV risk assessment.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>

<h4>COMING INTO VIEW:<BR>
WOMEN, FAMILIES &amp; AIDS</h4>

<font size=-1><p>For two years now, I have been interviewing mothers with AIDS and their children for psychological research studies. Unlike the general public, I have been privy to intimate and detailed accounts of their struggles and successes in coping with their illness. As a photographer, I have tried to embody their little known experiences in revealing images.</p>

<p>None have remained so in the dark as women with AIDS and their families. Despite the fact that women represent the most rapidly expanding group of the infected (men infect women with HIV at least six times as often as women infect men), they remain largely unseen and unheard. Where the gay male community has rallied against prejudice, the vast majority of women stay isolated, some (as they get sicker) never leaving their homes. While many have small family networks to support them, they disclose their illness to no one, fearing that they and their children will be ostracized. The women in my photographs are part of a tiny but growing group of infected women who are willing to go public to fight the stigma attached to AIDS.</p>

<p>These women come from a variety of backgrounds; some were IV drug users and prostitutes, one is a film actress and lawyer, one a published poet, one a college student, another an artist. Most of them contracted the virus from their husbands or partners. Two of the children pictured are also HIV positive, while another was born HIV positive and addicted to cocaine, but converted to negative and is now completely healthy. Many of the women are active in the AIDS field as counselors and educators. Most of them are photographed at home, where their lives go on, visibly almost unchanged.</p>

<h2>Consumer Information and Conflict Resolution Project</h2>



<h3>About the Project<br> <font size=-1>by Kenneth Lowry<br> Public Policy

Advocate</font></h3>



<blockquote>



<p>This letter contains the comments I made to the Division of AIDS Services

(DAS) Restructuring Committee on Friday March 10, 1995. The concerns of Persons

With AIDS (PWAs) and the Community Based Organizations (CBOs) which serve them

was the focus of that meeting. I am submitting these comments because, in my

view, this population can be better served by careful analysis of the actual

experiences of individual clients as they move through this labyrinthine system.

Development of policy designed to safeguard rights, and monitor the delivery of

services, can improve its efficacy and bring about cost efficient use of the

limited funds available in this time of budgetary restraints.</p>



<p>I strongly support the efforts by the City to restructure the Division of AIDS

Services and applaud the Department's commitment to consumer involvement. It is

in this regard I propose a Consumer Office for Information and Dispute

Resolution, be an integral part of the aforementioned restructuring. This Office,

available to all PWAs, would serve to inform clients of the specific attributes

of each program and help them to assist case workers in identifying the programs

which are most suited to their specific needs. It would be charged with resolving

disputes and provide a forum for airing grievances. Examination of the issues and

concerns consumers express to this Office will provide additional data for

program evaluation and analyses.</p>



<p>President Kennedy in his 1962 message to Congress on consumerism set forth the

following principles: <b>the right to safety</b>, <b>the right to be

informed</b>, <b>the right to choose</b>, and <b>the right to be heard</b>. In

addition this population would benefit from an office which reviews <b>issues of

confidentiality</b>. These tenets are of integral importance to realize the

objectives of consumer protection, and secure the common welfare of the social

aggregate. </p>



<p><b>The Right To Safety</b><br> Products and services should not pose undue

risk of physical harm or damage to consumers. Consumers with AIDS are often

unable to tolerate conditions with which the general public lives. In the past

year New York City has allowed a higher level of cryptosporidia in its water,

potentially endangering the lives of PWAs. Although this information is available

to the general public through various advocacy organizations or indeed through

public records, the implications for People With AIDS are not always clear. We

are fortunate to have organizations like the Gay Men's Health Crisis, which has

an excellent track record in this venue, but its arms can not reach the growing

diversity and sheer number of consumers we see today. Information and referral

could reach far into neighborhoods which are isolated from mainstream AIDS

populations and to PWAs who have no affiliation with advocates or AIDS Service

Organizations. The Consumer Office for Information and Dispute Resolution is

intended to meet this need.</p>



<p><b>The Right To Be Informed</b><br> Consumers need sufficient information in

order to choose wisely among the many different models of housing and other

services. Many consumers desperate for housing accept what appears to be the only

housing available, often times inappropriate for their specific needs. Informed

consumers can take an active role in discovering appropriate services among the

wide spectrum available, and regain some semblance of dignity and control of

their lives. A Consumer Office would serve its clients by identifying appropriate

sources of information and counseling, and making it available.</p>



<p><b>The Right To Choose</b><br> The structure of the American Free Market

System is based on the belief that, in theory, competition is the best regulator

of the marketplace and an informed public furthers its safeguards. In accordance

with this theory, consumers can help sustain the standards of service by the

freedom to choose where their funds are directed. Choice of health care providers

and plans is critical to maintaining stability for all people. For people living

with HIV disease and AIDS, that choice may determine the quality and length of

life. Blindly sweeping patients into HMOs or encouraging them to sign on to a

plan without the benefit of pertinent information will have significant

consequences on their health and well being. Choosing a plan or provider empowers

the patient to direct payments to appropriate services. In essence, regarding

entitlements as property rather than as a gratuity affords the recipient similar

protections which institutions regularly grant to the nonindigent and concede to

the rich. This could recreate an environment where private vendors compete for

dollars which are now given with minimal controls. This kind of power is

indicative of the rights and privilege which our founding fathers intended for

all citizens to enjoy.</p>



<p><b>The Right To Be Heard</b><br> Remedies for services that do not perform

properly are not available to people who have no alternatives from which to

choose. A consumer who has a grievance with an agency has little redress or

opportunity to be heard. This is a serious problem, in that litigation, fair

hearings, and in-house grievance mechanisms are time consuming, unnecessarily

costly and frequently self serving. Often times a simple venting of grievances

with a mediator will solve a plethora of seemingly insurmountable problems. This,

a consumer forum, is an ideal place to resolve delinquent financial accounts.</p>



<p><b>The Right To Confidentiality</b><br> Justice Robert Houghwout Jackson

wrote, "...[A] man's mere property status without more, cannot be used by a state

to test, qualify, or limit his rights as a citizen of the United States." Thus it

follows that in return for entitlements, and housing assistance, people need not

be required to relinquish to state or private organizations their Constitutional

Rights to privacy and personal security. Lists of Persons With AIDS in hospitals,

seized by unscrupulous opportunists are sold to reporters. Open files are left

unattended on desks in Community Based Organizations and Division of AIDS

Services offices. There are food and clothing programs that require copies of an

instrument designed for home care to qualify an applicant for pantry and

clothing. Unlicensed, poorly trained case workers collect and interpret detailed,

confidential information which a licensee could not disclose. That these

practices affront explicit Constitutional Rights, will be the subjects of

litigation far into the future.</p>



<p>I propose that establishment of a Consumer Office for Information and Dispute

Resolution within the structure of the Division of AIDS Services will greatly

improve the efficiency of the agency and ensure that the needs of People with

AIDS are met. The Office would accommodate care for the rights and safety of the

weak and infirm, facilitate the gathering and dissemination of information,

provide for assessment and evaluation of programs and services, and eschew costly

litigation by providing a reasonable way of settling disputes without enlisting

the courts. I propose a trifurcate office functioning with the following

divisions: 1). Information and referral monitoring. 2) Alternative Dispute

Resolution (ADR) and 3) Data Analyses and Program Evaluation.</p>



<P><b>Information and Referral Monitoring Center</b><br> This Office will serve

to facilitate and monitor referrals to the various AIDS systems and services.

Consumers need sufficient information in order to choose wisely among the many

different models of housing and other services. A Consumer Office would assist

DAS clients in making these choices by identifying appropriate services.

Information provided by this office will enhance the training of case workers.

Material will flow from the Consumer Office to DAS Office Directors and CBOs to

assist them in serving their clients. While case workers and advocates will be

the primary on-line disseminators of information, clients and service providers

would have a reciprocal relationship with the Office. Clients and service

providers can utilize the Office to address policy issues and promote practical

alternatives and remedies to the existing system. Conflict Resolution Center Many

disputes are thought too insignificant to warrant serious consideration. Clients

with adjudicative controversies face a system littered with frustrated

expectations for those who find it too complicated to understand, too quixotic to

be relevant, too peremptory to encourage compliance, too costly to be prudent,

and a process too lengthy to be salutary for terminally ill citizens. After

receiving a complaint the Office will send a letter to both parties giving a date

for the mediation and suggesting they try to negotiate a settlement prior to the

meeting. The letter will state: the concerns around adjudication, the possible

alternatives for action and explain the process of Alternative Dispute Resolution

if resolution is not met independently. Mediators will meet with both parties

together and separately to negotiate a binding settlement. Research indicates

compliance with these agreements is generally more consistent than with court

settlements and considerably less expensive. This Office will link with

established Conflict Resolution Centers and will train mediators to perpetuate

its mission.</p>



<p>This Office would screen potential cases, obtain member parties' agreement to

participate in the dispute resolution process, sensitize and train a pool of

mediators from existing court and community dispute resolution centers to the

specific needs and concerns of PWAs and set and collect fees for ADR

mediations.</p>



<p><b>Data Analyses And Program Evaluation Center</b></p> This office of

ombudsman would benefit the Division of AIDS Services as a neutral investigatory

arm, helping to navigate the several bureaucracies, and compelling the parties to

comply with policy and contractual agreements. It would suggest an appropriate

course of action following its investigation. One of its primary investigative

tools would be a "dispute resolution audit". The advantages of this audit

include:</p>



<ul> <li>It can track complaints to identify systemic issues that can be

addressed comprehensively through policy. <li>It can discover whether there are

areas of repetitive problems in which dissatisfaction among consumers is rampant

or merely troublesome. <li>It can determine whether the Departments' or Contract

Organizations' internal processes for handling these problems are effective and

whether there are alternatives that might respond better to structure or need.

<li>It can effectively evaluate programs and client services by utilizing data

collected through tracking referrals and processing complaints. <li>It can

consider what provisions, regulations, or restrictions are necessary for

government contracts with key providers, suppliers, consultants, or employees,

for this population. </ul>



<p><b>Staffing</b><br> An independent commission comprised of volunteer consumers

from various disciplines and representing each Borough would maintain supervisory

status, protecting substantive and procedural rights. A small staff

(approximately 2) with appropriate administrative support could carry out the

business of this office. It would link with volunteer mediators from the network

of mediation centers. The Office, staffed by civil servants, will be afforded

stability, and permanence.</p>



<p><b>Summary</b><br> The Consumer Office for Information and Dispute Resolution

will serve to centralize complaints and determine courses of action. An office

staffed with civil employees within the structure of DAS and supported by an

independent commission will give credibility and legitimacy to its objectives.

Coordination and dissemination of information gathered from the various factions

of the AIDS community will help PWAs negotiate the system. The Office will

suggest alternatives for successful interaction with an environmental design, in

which this minority does not fit. Independence and neutrality, necessary for

consumer and member organization confidence, is achieved by links with community

and court mediation centers and the reciprocal relationship of the -consumer

-service provider- City- alliance. A network of consumer volunteers working

within the structure of DAS creates a synergy which assures the sincerity of the

City's commitment to this population.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Consumer News</b> is a People With AIDS (PWA), generated
paper that addresses the concerns of Consumers Living with AIDS. Its mission  is
to inform, and to illustrate the choices that educated consumers can have that
may affect the quality and stability of life and health. The  articles in this
publication are primarily quality of life and policy issues. PWAs and other
experts in AIDS write them.</p>

<p>PWAs are encouraged to write to this paper with concerns they wish to see
addressed. We will address them as best we can in one of the following ways.</p>

<ul> <li>We will investigate or research and publish a response to the problem.
<li>We will confront the parties in conflict by letter, phone, or private
interview, and report the disposition. We may elect to publish the results,
(respecting confidentiality laws and practices), if the scope of the issue will
benefit a number of PWAs or AIDS Service Organizations (ASOs). We look to
encourage resolutions to the concerns of consumers and reward exceptional service
and flexibility by ASOs. <li>We will refer the problem to the Conflict Resolution
Project to identify a mediator to intervene. </ul>

<p>If selected, Letters to the Editor,  will be  published as written. Articles
will be edited. We wish to invite all to submit articles or ideas for articles.
We will provide small stipends to PWAs whose articles we publish.Volunteer
reporters and researchers are encouraged to contact us by mail. Write to Consumer
News, P.O. Box 41, Cooper Station, New York, New York 10026-0041. E-mail  <a

<h3>PROGRAMS</h3>

<p><b>PROJECT CARE</b>:  Project Care provides in-home permanency planning services to seriously ill parents who need to find a secure new home for their children.  Through guided conversations and interactive exercises, Family Specialists encourage children and parents to talk about illness and to design appropriate plans for the future.  Legal, health care coordination, counseling, housing and entitlement services are integral components of this program.</p>

<p><b>PROJECT SHARE</b>:  Project Share is a three-year research study designed to describe the permanency planning process in families with AIDS through interviews with parents, new guardians, and children ages 8 to 11.  The data will be used to create programs that respond to identified family needs and enhance family functioning.</p>

<p><b>PROJECT TALK</b>:  Project Talk is a four-year research study, launched in 1993, which assesses the effectiveness of a structured mental health intervention for well adolescents and their parents with AIDS.  Adolescents ages 12 to 18 and their parents meet in twelve weekly group sessions and are then followed, through in-home visits and by telephone, for two years.</p>

<p><b>PROJECT HELP</b>: Volunteers make a significant contribution by giving their time, skills and affection to our families and staff.  </p>

<p><b>FAMILY ADVISORY COMMITTEE</b>:   Families affected by AIDS participate on a committee that evaluates existing Family Center programs and provides a voice in designing and implementing new ones.  Family members are also trained to give interviews to print and television journalists and to speak directly to the public, elected officials, and policy makers.</p>

<p><b>PERMANENCY PLANNING NETWORK</b>:  The Family Center co-founded and co-directs the Permanency Planning Network with the <A HREF="../orphan/index.html">Orphan Project</A>, a consortium of more than 40 legal, social service and medical providers in lower New York State, plus representatives of Washington-based government funding agencies.  Launched in 1994, Network members meet monthly to exchange information, identify service gaps and evolving needs, make client referrals, avoid service duplication and advocate for public policies that address the needs of children and families.</p>

<h3>ADMINISTRATION AND STAFFING</h3>

<p>The Family Center is a program of the not-for-profit Medical and Health Research Association of New York City, Inc.  It receives funding from the Health Resources and  Services Administration, the National Institute of Mental Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  and the New York State AIDS Institute, among others.  Its professional staff of 25 is drawn from the fields of social work, law, public health, nursing and psychology.</p>

<blockquote><font size=-1>

<h3>FACT SHEET</h3>

<h4>CLIENTS </h4> 
<ul>
<li>God's Love We Deliver (GLWD) delivers fresh, nourishing meals to homebound people with AIDS throughout New York City and nearby Hudson County, New Jersey. We also provide meals for our clients' dependent children.
<p>
<li>We are currently serving over 900 clients each day. Statistics indicate that this figure will continue to rise in the coming months and years.
<p>
<li>The demographics of our clients closely reflects the demographics of the local epidemic, as reported in updates published by the New York City and New Jersey State Departments of Health. 
<p>
<li>Clients enroll in our program with a brief telephone call; they receive their first meal deliveries within 24 hours of calling. (AIDS diagnoses are verified within the next two weeks.)
</ul>
<h4>MEALS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Menus are developed collaboratively by the kitchen staff and our team of HIV Nutrition Specialists.
<p>
<li>Each daily delivery contains two delicious, well-balanced meals (lunch and dinner) which provide a minimum of 2,200 calories and 90 grams of protein.
<p>
<li>The hot luncheon entree includes 8-10 ounces of meat, fish or poultry; 6 ounces of potatoes, pasta, rice, or other grain; and 5 ounces of fresh vegetables. The evening meal consists of 16 ounces of hearty, homemade soup; a 5-ounce protein salad platter; and a freshly-baked dessert. 
<p>
<li>We prepare "modified meals" for clients whose medical conditions interfere with their ability to eat or digest regularly prepared foods. Approximately one-third of each day's clients (for example, those whose kidneys are no longer functioning) receive meals which have been specially tailored to meet their needs. 
</ul>

<h4>VOLUNTEERS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Volunteers are essential to our daily activities. They prepare meals in our kitchen, serve on our board of directors, plan fundraising events, assist in our offices, and deliver meals to our clients.
<p>
<li>GLWD's volunteer base is wonderfully diverse. Our 2,250 active volunteers come from all walks of life, every socioeconomic class, every religion, and every ethnic group; they are young and old, male and female, gay and straight. They live throughout our service area, which spans 440 square miles.
<p>
<li>Our meals are delivered through a network of 62 community-based Neighborhood Meal Distribution Centers. These churches, synagogues, small businesses, and schools serve as drop-off points for our drivers and pick-up points for the neighborhoods' delivery volunteers. 
</ul>
<h4>NUTRITION EDUCATION AND COUNSELING</h4>
<ul>
<li>GLWD's team of HIV Nutrition Specialists provides HIV+ people with information on how dietary changes can help them prevent or halt malnutrition, manage symptoms, and reduce the side-effects of medications.
<p>
<li>We are currently counseling more than 300 individuals each month. 
<p>
<li>Our culturally appropriate education materials reinforce the information presented in our counseling sessions and allow us to reach people outside our immediate service area. 
</ul>
<h4>FUNDING</h4>
<ul>
<li>God's Love We Deliver's services are funded through an extensive and well-balanced base of support. 
<p>
<li>In FY 94/95, individual contributions (including direct mail responses, bequests, and other major individual gifts) accounted for 32% of the total budget. Remaining funding came from government sources (34%), foundations (12%), donated services and materials (10%), corporations (6%), special events (5%), and miscellaneous sources (1%).

<blockquote><font size=-1>

<h3>WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM</h3>

<p>God’s Love We Deliver was designed to feed men, women and children living with AIDS who are currently homebound. We serve nutritious and delicious meals prepared daily in our kitchen and delivered to you in your home. You will receive one delivery per day which includes lunch and dinner plus dessert. We will cook your meals and deliver them free of charge; as a partner in the program, you need only to be home to receive your meals, and, of course, enjoy them. The Client Services office is open Monday through Friday from 8:00am-6:00pm, year round except the Friday after Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day. We are closed on the weekends.</p>

<h3>HOW YOUR MEALS ARE DELIVERED</h3>

<p>Each morning our vans leave the kitchen no later than 9:00 am carrying your meals in temperature controlled tubs. The drivers then deliver the meals directly to you or drop thermal containers at Neighborhood Meal Distribution Centers where volunteers pack your meals and deliver them to you.  Meal Delivery is scheduled from 9:30 am - 3:00 pm. If you are expecting a meal delivery and you have not received it by 2:00 pm, please call Client Services at: <b>212-294-8102</b>; if you use a pay phone, call us toll free at 1-800-747-2023, ext.102.</p>

<p>You will always need to sign for your meal. Your Driver will provide a sheet for you to sign or you will receive a voucher card which you sign each day and mail back (postage paid) every week. </p>

<h3>YOUR FIRST DAY</h3>

<p>Today your meals are being delivered by a staff member who has your Intake packet. This includes: this pamphlet, two Client Agreements, (one for you to sign and give back to the staff member and one for you to keep) plus instructions for you to give to your doctor for written diagnosis verification. The Client Agreement includes our program guidelines which you can share with  your support network. This pamphlet and the Client Agreement also have our phone numbers. We encourage you and your support network to call with any questions about the program.</p>

<h3>HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM</h3>

<p>You must be home to receive your meals. We cannot leave the meals with anyone but you.</p>
       
<ul><li><b>CANCELLATIONS</b>

<dt>If you are not going to be home during delivery hours, you or a member of your support network are responsible for calling us  24 hours in advance to cancel your meal delivery for that day. You will receive meals again the next day.
<p>
<li><b>MIA: MISSING IN ACTION</b>
<dt>If you are not home when you have a delivery scheduled, we will not return to you until you call us. When you call us to restart meal deliveries, there is a 48 hour waiting period. If you miss three deliveries in thirty days without calling us to cancel, you can be suspended from meal delivery service for 30 days.
<p>
<li><b>TEMPORARILY OFF</b>
<dt>If you are leaving your home for a period of time (vacation, hospital stay, etc.) you will need to temporarily come off the program. We will stop deliveries until you call us again to restart. When you call, deliveries will begin the following day. There is not a 48 hour waiting period when you restart.
<p>
<li><b>MAKING A SCHEDULE</b>
<dt>Sometimes you may have standing appointments such as dialysis or chemotherapy. In order for you to receive enough food for the days you won’t be home, we can accommodate you by setting up a schedule. For example, if you go to therapy every Tuesday and Thursday, we can deliver double meals on Monday and Wednesday and skip you on your therapy days.

<h3>WHAT DOES HOMEBOUND MEAN?</h3>

<p>For most people with AIDS, homebound status fluctuates. You may need us when you have been discharged from the hospital, or you may need us while you are doing a treatment at home; but often after just a few weeks of receiving our meals, you may no longer be homebound. When that happens, all you need to do is call us so that we can take you off the program. Should you become homebound again, all you need to do is call us to restart your meals the next day. Once you register for meals, you will always be registered; but we will only deliver when you are homebound.</p>

<h3>NUTRITION SERVICES</h3>

<p>Clinical research indicates that good nutrition is essential for long-term survival and may slow the advancement of AIDS. Nutrition education and counseling is recommended for people living with AIDS in order to stay as healthy as possible. We provide free nutrition counseling and encourage you to call us. Your meal plan can decrease the many side effects of  infections and medications. Good nutrition also can help you to maintain your weight, reduce wasting and maximize your medical therapies.</p>

<p>We can provide samples of nutrition supplements to registered clients. Please call us with any questions, especially if you start new medical treatments, change medications, or lose weight.</p>

<h3>FOOD SAFETY</h3>

<p>Our HIV Nutrition Specialists recommend the following guidelines to ensure that your meals are safe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refrigerate all food that you do not eat right away.
<p>
<li>Soup and Entree should always be hot. If your meal is not hot or has been in the refrigerator, reheat it for 15 minutes at 350 degrees in the oven, or remove from tin and microwave on high for 4 minutes.
<p>
<li>If you use a hot plate, heat on high setting until the inside of the food is piping hot.
<p>
<li>Salad should always be cold. Store salad and dessert in the refrigerator.
<p>
<li>Throw away leftovers that have been in the refrigerator for more than 2 days.
</ul>

<p><a name="introduction"><b>Eating</a> Tips for HIV Disease</b><br>
A strong connection exists between what you eat and your immune system's ability to fight off disease.  Eating healthy food is especially important when you are HIV positive in order to increase your physical strength so that you can enjoy life as normally as possible.  <b>Good nutrition is a cotherapy</b> that can help to maximize your medical management of HIV disease.  Aggressive nutrition can prevent or delay the loss of your muscle tissue, a process that is also called HIV wasting.  Research indicates that your nutritional health is a major factor influencing HIV survival.  Currently, there is no cure for HIV disease or AIDS, but <b>you can affect the disease process and improve the quality of your life by maintaining a positive attitude and a healthy lifestyle</b>.  Some healthy lifestyle changes you can make include:</p>

<ol>
<li>following appropriate medical interventions to treat infections; 
<li>choosing to eat healthy food; 
<li>managing stress in positive ways; 
<li>engaging in regular weight resistance exercise; and 
<li>integrating natural or alternative therapies into your personal health management plan.
</ol>

<p>All of these therapies work together to help your immune system fight HIV.</p>

<p>People with HIV or AIDS tend to lose their muscle tissue and protein stores with varying amounts of fat loss. There are three major reasons why you may lose weight, experience muscle wasting and develop HIV-related malnutrition.  If you have a poor appetite, you may not eat enough protein, calories, vitamins and minerals that your body needs; your body's metabolism speeds up during active infection so you need extra calories and protein from food to maintain your weight; and if you have chronic diarrhea, your body loses calories, protein, vitamins and minerals.</p>

<p> Your muscle tissue is very important to keep you strong, maintain body functions and help process medications. <b>A major nutritional goal for HIV disease is to build or maintain your muscle weight</b>.  You can do this by eating food and drinking fluids high in calories so that your body does not use your muscle tissue for energy during active infection.  These types of food give your body energy: complex starches or carbohydrates, simple sugars and fats. You also need food that provides your body with protein to build and maintain your muscle mass.  You can choose a combination of animal or complemented vegetable protein sources depending on your preference. You also need to engage in daily and repetitive weight resistance exercise to gain muscle strength.<p>

<p>It is very important to eat small amounts of food throughout the day, even if you are not hungry.  <b>A high protein, high calorie eating plan that is rich in complex starches and includes moderate amounts of fat is best for you to help prevent muscle wasting with HIV disease</b>.  This may change if you have specific symptoms or other existing medical problems.  Your nutritionist or physician can help you decide how to modify your eating plan if you have specific symptoms.  This guide offers eating tips for maximizing your protein and energy intake to gain quality weight.  It includes guidelines for taking vitamin and mineral supplements, suggestions for managing nutrition problems that may interfere with your ability to eat, and basic food safety tips and recipes.</p>

<p><a name="high calorie"><b>Guidelines</a> for a High Calorie Meal Plan</b><br>
When you are HIV positive, it is important to eat enough calories because HIV infection increases your body's energy needs.  A calorie is a way of measuring the energy that food supplies.  It is good to eat a lot of high energy food called <b>complex carbohydrates</b> or <b>starches</b>that include whole grain breads and cereals, pasta, potatoes and rice.  Fruits, vegetables and <b>simple sugars</b> also give your body quick energy.  Fats provide many calories, but they are not a good source of energy for your muscles. <b> Fats</b> give you extra energy to burn and build body fat.  If you do not eat enough calories from carbohydrates, your body will break down your muscles for energy.  You may not have an appetite when you are sick and notice that you are gradually losing weight.  It is important to try to eat small amounts throughout the day, even if you are not hungry.</p>

<p><b>To increase your calorie intake:</b></p>

<ul><li> Eat six small meals throughout the day.
<li> Keep snacks near your bed or by the television.
<li> Pack non-perishable food to snack on when you are away from home.
<li> Engage in light exercise before you eat to build up an appetite.</ul>

<p><b>Complex starches or carbohydrates are the best type of energy to build and maintain your muscle tissue. Eat generous portions of: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pasta (whole wheat or enriched macaroni, spaghetti or noodles)
<li>Rice (brown and white), barley, millet, tabouli and couscous
<li>Oatmeal, cream of wheat, farina, rice cereal, corn meal, grits and cold cereals
<li>Breads, tortillas, muffins, biscuits, crackers, dumplings, pancakes and waffles
<li>Potatoes, yams, plantain, yuca, breadfruit, corn, green peas and lima beans
<li>Cooked kidney beans, navy beans, lentils, black-eyed peas, pigeon peas and chickpeas
</ul>

<p><b>Simple sugars give you extra energy to gain muscle and fat weight.  For extra energy:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Snack on fresh fruit or dried fruit (raisins, dates, apricots, pineapple, papaya and prunes).
<li>Add jelly, jam, honey and maple syrup to hot and cold cereal, pancakes and waffles.
<li>Add honey, sugar, molasses or syrup to milkshakes, hot or cold tea, Kool-Aid and lemonade.
<li>Top ice cream, frozen or regular yogurt with fresh or dried fruit and syrup.
<li>Snack on cakes, pies, cookies and candy between meals. 
</ul>

<p><b>Fats give you extra energy to burn and to gain body fat.  Eat moderate amounts.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Add butter, margarine, sour cream, cream cheese or peanut butter to sandwiches, crackers, pancakes, waffles and hot cereal. 
<li>Add gravy to meat, chicken, turkey, mashed and baked potatoes.<br>
 Add sour cream, cream cheese, grated cheese, butter or margarine to mashed or baked potatoes.
<li>Top salads with avocado, olives and extra salad dressing.
<li> If you are not lactose intolerant, add condensed milk, evaporated milk, whole milk or cream to granola, hot and cold cereals.
</ul>

<p><b><a name="high protein">Guidelines</a> for a High Protein Meal Plan</b><br>
Eating enough protein is important when your body is fighting off or recovering from infections.  Protein builds muscle tissue and also helps your immune system fight infections.  You can obtain protein either from animal or vegetable sources.  Eat generous portions of protein at each meal.  Good sources include:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Animal Protein</b>
<dt>Fish, chicken, turkey, red meat (veal, lamb, beef, pork, rabbit or venison) and organ meats (liver), gizzards.
<dt>Eggs, cheese, milk products.
<li><b>Vegetable Protein</b>
<dt>Cooked beans (kidney beans, black-eyed peas, soybeans or garbanzo beans), falafel.
<dt>Split peas and lentils.
<dt>Tofu, tempeh, miso and seitan (flavored wheat gluten).
<dt>Fortified soymilk (rice milk, cashew milk or almond milk with added protein powder).
<dt>Nuts (walnuts, pecans, cashews or almonds) and nut butters (peanut butter or cashew butter).
<dt>Seeds (sesame or pumpkin) and seed butters (tahini).
</ul>

<p><b>Suggestions for increasing protein in your meals:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Use hard-boiled eggs to make egg salad sandwiches; add sliced or diced hard-boiled eggs to salads; eat desserts that are made with eggs (muffins, cookies, custard, pudding, angel food or sponge cake); add eggbeaters or protein powder to milkshakes; and try french toast for sandwiches instead of regular bread.
<li>Add diced meats, chopped chicken or turkey to soups, salads and sauces.
<li>Add canned tuna, salmon, sardines, shrimp or crabmeat to casseroles and salads.
<li>Grate cheese into sauces, soups, omelettes, baked potatoes and steamed vegetables; add shredded or diced cheese to tossed salad, chicken salad or potato salad; try cottage cheese with fruit, green salads or mix into casseroles like baked ziti.  Snack on cheese and crackers or on cheese and fruit between meals.
<li>Use milk, Lactaid milk, fortified soymilk or nut milks in hot or cold cereals, cream soups and fruit shakes. Eat yogurt with dry cereal or fruit.  Buy yogurt that contains an active <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> culture.  <i>L. acidophilus</i> is a good bacteria that reduces the amount of lactose in the yogurt so you will be able to digest it more easily than regular milk if you have a problem with lactose intolerance.  If you have diarrhea resulting from antibiotics, yogurt may help to reduce your diarrhea.
<li>Spread nut butters (peanut, cashew or pistachio) on bread, toast, crackers, fresh fruit or raw vegetables.
<li>Add beans to soups and salads; spread bean dip on bread, crackers or raw vegetables; add cubed tofu, tempeh or chopped seitan to soups, salads and casseroles.
</ul>

<p><a name="vitamin"><b>Vitamin</a> and Mineral Supplements</b><br>
<b>Vitamins</b> and <b>minerals</b> are substances that your body cannot make but needs in small amounts to survive.  They are also known as <b>micronutrients</b>.  Vitamins and minerals are involved in specific reactions in your body and need to be taken with food because they must interact with protein, fat and carbohydrates in order to be effective.  Healthy people who eat a variety of food every day usually do not need to take a multivitamin and mineral supplement because they meet their requirements from the food they eat.  If you are HIV positive or have AIDS, you need more than what food provides, especially if you have a poor appetite and skip meals, if your body is fighting off infections or if you have chronic diarrhea.</p>

<p>Specific vitamin and mineral deficiencies can add to the immune suppression brought on by not eating enough calories and protein.  These include vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin C, zinc, selenium, iron and copper. <b> If you are HIV positive and asymptomatic</b>, you would benefit from taking a multivitamin and mineral supplement daily that is at least 100% of the U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances (USRDA).  The USRDA is a nutritional standard set by the government for levels people need in order to prevent deficiencies and to maintain health.  A good brand name choice of a multivitamin and mineral supplement is <b>Centrum </b>or <b>Theragran-M</b>.  You can <b>ask your physician to write a prescription for a multivitamin and mineral supplement that can be covered by Medicaid or ADAP</b>.  If you want extra protection, you may choose to take a multivitamin and mineral supplement that has higher levels of vitamins and minerals than what the USRDA provides.  You will need to buy higher dosages yourself because currently they are not reimbursable.  Check the contents to make sure that you do not take very high dosages that can cause side-effects.  Pay special attention to your dosage of vitamin A (retinol), vitamin D, vitamin B6, zinc, selenium, iron and copper.</p>

<p>If you are <b>HIV positive and symptomatic</b>, you would benefit from taking two multivitamin and mineral supplement pills daily with meals.  As HIV disease progresses, research has shown that you can become deficient in certain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B12, folate, vitamin B6, zinc and selenium.  You can ask your physician to order serum or blood levels of these vitamins and minerals at the time that you have a CBC taken to determine if you need higher dosages to correct existing deficiencies.  Some people prefer to take therapeutic dosages of individual vitamins and minerals either to prevent deficiencies or to enhance immune function.  Growing evidence suggests that therapeutic doses of beta-carotene, vitamin E and vitamin C may act as antioxidants to reduce the level of free radicals produced by HIV infection.  If you choose to take supplements, the following dosages are safe, but you should be monitored by your healthcare team.</p>

<p><a name="fluids"><b>Fluids</b></a><br>
Drinking enough fluids is very important when you are HIV positive.  Fluids help prevent dehydration, especially when you are taking many medications.  You need a great deal of fluids to flush out medications that have been used by your body.  If you are having a difficult time maintaining your weight, drink<b> high calorie fluids </b>(juices, nectars, fruit punch, ice tea, lemonade, ginger ale, soda, Gatorade and Kool-Aid) and <b>high calorie, high protein fluids </b>(e.g., milk, milkshakes, Lactaid milk, fortified soymilk, fortified nut milks, Ensure Plus, Resource Plus, Sustacal, Nutren 2.0 and Nutrament)<b> instead of water</b>.  Drink at least eight glasses of fluid each day.  Drink more if you are taking many medications.  You will need to drink more if the inside of your mouth or tongue is dry.  Avoid drinking beverages that contain caffeine, especially if you have diarrhea.  These products cause further loss of fluid from your body.  Caffeine-containing beverages include coffee, black tea and some types of soda.  Avoid drinking alcohol because it is low in nutrients and can also dehydrate you. </p>

<p>Certain germs can be spread through tap water and make you very sick when your CD4 count is below 200 cells/mm3.  <i><a href="../network/simple/crypto.html">Cryptosporidiosis</a>, Mycrosporidiosis</i> and<i> <a href="../network/simple/mac.html">Mycobacterium avium</i> complex</a> (MAC) can be passed to you through water and cause flu-like symptoms that include cramping, diarrhea, fevers, nausea and weight loss. <b> If you drink water</b>, buy spring water filtered to 2 microns, distilled water or bottled carbonated water, such as seltzer.  If you drink tap water, boil it for five minutes to kill germs, and cool it before using it to make ice tea, lemonade, Kool-Aid or to dilute fruit juice concentrate.  Bottled juices are safe to drink if they are pasteurized.</p> 

<p><b>Dry Mouth</b> can occur as a result of not drinking enough fluids or as a side-effect of medications.  In addition to drinking enough fluids, the following suggestions can help you manage this problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use extra sauce, butter, gravy, yogurt or salad dressing to moisten food.
<li>Dunk or soak bread, crackers and cookies in soup, milk, juice or hot chocolate.
<li>Suck on sugar-free candy or sour balls, popsicles, ice cubes, or try chewing sugarless gum to stimulate salivation.
<li>Sleep with a humidifier in your room, and keep fluids by your bedside so you can drink throughout the night  if you are thirsty.
</ul>

<p><b>Constipation</b> can occur as a result of not drinking enough, not eating enough food or fiber and remaining inactive.  Constipation can also develop as a side-effect of certain medications, especially methadone or narcotic-based pain medications.  In addition to drinking enough fluids, the following suggestions can help you manage this problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eat food high in insoluble fiber: whole grain breads and cereals, fresh fruits and vegetables, cooked beans  and chickpeas, nuts and seeds.
<li>Add small amounts of bran to food or liquids to increase dietary fiber.
<li>Incorporate regular aerobic exercise into your daily schedule.
<li>Ask your doctor about medications to relieve constipation.
</ul>

<p><a name="food"><b>Food Safety</b></a><br>
Food safety guidelines are important to follow when your immune system is weakened by HIV.  Germs can be passed to you from food that is undercooked or handled improperly.  A food-borne illness can make you very sick.  Symptoms of food poisoning can include fever, nausea, vomiting, cramping and diarrhea.  The following guidelines can help you protect yourself from getting food poisoning when you are preparing and storing food.</p>

<p><b>Preparing Food</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly with warm water, a mild soap and a soft bristle brush.  You can  also use a mixture of 1/2 cup lemon juice to a gallon of warm water.  Or, you can remove the skin or the peel from fruits and vegetables before you eat them.
<li>Cook meat, poultry and fish to a medium or medium-well stage so that they are barely pink.  Do not eat rare  meat, poultry or raw fish or seafood, including sushi or steamed clams.
<li>Thaw frozen meat and poultry on a plate in the refrigerator, not at room temperature.Drink pasteurized milk only.  Unpasteurized milk or dairy products can carry <i>Salmonella</i>.
<li>Do not use eggs that have cracks in their shells.  Boil eggs for at least five minutes or fry eggs for at least 3 minutes on each side.  Avoid eggs that are lightly poached or prepared over easy.  Also avoid food  containing raw or partially cooked eggs, such as homemade mayonnaise, hollandaise sauce, homemade ice cream and eggnog, raw cake or cookie batter, Caesar's salad and the Spanish drink, ponche.
<li>Do not eat soft ripened cheeses, such as Brie and Camembert.  
<li>Throw away moldy cheese.
<li>Do not eat directly from a storage container 
because bacteria from your mouth can make the food spoil faster.  Do not use the spoon you eat with as a serving spoon.
<li>Make a dilute bleach mix by adding 1-2 tablespoons of bleach to a gallon of warm water.  Use this mix to clean kitchen utensils and cutting boards before and after preparing food.  Plastic cutting boards are easier  to clean than wooden cutting boards.
<li>Wash your hands with warm, soapy water before and after preparing food.
</ul>

<p><b>Storing Food</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Refrigerate food that you do not intend on eating immediately.
<li>If you are making a large amount of food, divide portions into small containers and refrigerate so that the food cools quickly and bacterial growth is slowed.
<li>Cover food tightly with plastic wrap or store in air tight containers to retain freshness.Do not allow drippings from defrosted food to touch other food in the refrigerator.
<li>Refrigerate all cooking and salad oils. Oils can become rancid when stored for long periods of time at room temperature.
<li>Do not eat leftovers that have been sitting in the refrigerator for more than two days.
<li>Do not eat food beyond the expiration date stamped on the container.
</ul>

<p><a name="poor"><b>Poor Appetite</b></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Eat six small meals throughout the day (e.g., 8:30 am breakfast, 10:00 am snack, 12:30 pm lunch, 3:00 pm snack, 5:30 pm dinner, 7:30 pm snack).
<li>Keep snacks near your bed or by the television in your house or apartment.
<li>Do light exercise, stretching or deep breathing before you eat.
<li>Eat your favorite food, even if it is just a little bit.
<li>Drink a liquid nutritional supplement or a homemade fruit shake instead of skipping a meal.Prepare a large amount of food, and freeze in single portion-sized packages.
<li>Ask your doctor or nutritionist about medications that can stimulate your appetite, including:  Marinol, Periactin and Megace.
</ul>

<p><a name="nausea"><b>Nausea</a> and Vomiting</b></p>

<p>Nausea and vomiting may be caused by infections as well as by some medications and treatments. The following suggestions may help you to manage symptoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eat small, frequent snack-sized meals throughout the day rather than two or three big meals, and drink high calorie fluids one hour after you eat.
<li>Do not eat liquid and solid food at the same meal.  Space them at least one hour apart.
<li>Avoid eating greasy, fried or spicy food.  Instead, choose bland tasting cold food.
<li>Choose dry food, such as boxed cereal, crackers, melba toast and cookies.  You can keep these close to your bed or favorite chair so that they are within close reach.
<li>Eat salty food, such as crackers, pretzels and unbuttered popcorn to reduce nausea.
<li>Don't lie down flat for at least one hour after you eat.  Let food digest before you go to sleep.
<li>Eat food cold or at room temperature.  Hot food can worsen nausea.
<li>Avoid eating your favorite food when you feel sick.  You may end up disliking them because you  associate them with feeling nauseated.  If the smell of food makes you sick, ask someone else to cook for you, and stay away from the kitchen while food is being prepared for you.
<li>Drinking a cup of herbal tea with honey (e.g., peppermint or chamomile) or chewing on fresh ginger root can  sometimes settle an upset 
stomach.
<li>Ask your doctor about anti-nausea medication, such as Compazine, Reglan or Marinol.  If one medication does not work, your doctor can give you stronger medication.  Take the medication one half-hour before eating.
</ul>

<p><a name="mouth"><b>Mouth Pain</b></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol because these can irritate the inside of your mouth.
<li>Eat cold food to numb your taste buds, such as sherbet, fruit ice, frozen yogurt or ice cream.
<li>Eat soft, bland food, including applesauce, oatmeal, grits, cream of wheat, cream soups, custard, pudding, cooked meats and mashed hard-boiled eggs, and drink non-acidic juices and nectars.
<li>Avoid acidic food and fluids (e.g., citrus juices, tomato sauce and vinegar), spicy and salty food.
<li>Avoid eating very hot food and drinking carbonated soda which can make mouth sores burn.  Allow food to cool down to a lukewarm temperature before eating.
</ul>

<p><a name="painful"><b>Painful Swallowing</b></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Use a straw for drinking fluids, and use a cup or glass instead of a bowl for eating soup.  Tilt your head back to make swallowing easier.
<li>Choose soft-textured food (oatmeal, cream of wheat, canned fruits, cottage cheese, yogurt, pudding or  custard).  Puree food in a blender or food processor if you cannot tolerate soft food.
<li>Eat food at room temperature.  Avoid eating food that is either very hot or very cold. Try a variety of liquid nutritional supplements that are high in calories and protein, in addition to soft or pureed food.  Examples include Ensure Plus, Sustacal, Resource Plus, Nutren 2.0 and Nutrament.  You will need to determine what tastes good to you.  Try blending fresh or canned fruit with vanilla and strawberry flavors, or blend a banana with a chocolate flavor.  If you are underweight, ask your nutritionist, doctor or case manager how to get nutritional supplements through Medicaid or ADAP.
</ul>

<p><a name="taste"><b>Taste Changes</b></a></p>

<p>Oral infections such as thrush and certain medications can change your ability to taste and enjoy your favorite food.  You may have sensitive taste buds and need to eat bland food.  Or, you may have a bitter and metallic taste in your mouth.  The following suggestions may help when you have taste changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Before you eat, rinse your mouth with a mixture of one teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide or baking soda and a glass of warm distilled water.  Swish the mixture around your mouth, but do not swallow.  Remember to take your anti-fungal medication regularly to prevent oral or esophageal thrush if this is a problem for you.
<li>Use a toothbrush with soft bristles and a flavored toothpaste to clean your teeth and your tongue before and after you eat.
<li>Tart food can mask a metallic taste.  Try drinking orange, cranberry or pineapple juice and lemonade. 
<li>Add vinegar, lemon juice, pickles or relish to your food.
<li>Marinate meat, chicken, turkey, fish or tofu in vinegar, wine, salad dressing or soy sauce.Add fresh or dry herbs to your food (rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano or cumin).
<li>Try different food textures (chopped nuts or seeds) to make eating more interesting.
<li>Eat cold food, such as sherbet, fruit ice, frozen yogurt or ice cream to numb your taste buds.
</ul>

<p><a name="diarrhea"><b>Diarrhea</b></a><br>
Diarrhea may result from infections, medications or changes in your intestines.  The type and severity of diarrhea may vary according to the cause and to your tolerance to specific food.  Diarrhea can lead to the loss of fluid and minerals, causing dehydration and weakness.  The following suggestions may help to reduce your symptoms: </p>

<ul>
<li>Drink plenty of fluids with calories to replace what you lose with chronic diarrhea.  These fluids include juices (grape, cranberry, diluted orange juice), fruit punch, nectars (apricot, peach, pear mango and banana), ice tea, lemonade, Gatorade, Kool-Aid and liquid nutritional supplements.  Water is not a good choice for the majority of your fluid intake because it does not give you calories or protein.  Drink at least eight glasses of high calorie, high protein fluids each day.  Avoid alcoholic beverages and those containing caffeine, including coffee, black tea, chocolate drinks and soda.  Drink fluids at room temperature because very cold or hot liquids may worsen your diarrhea.
<li>Avoid milk or milk products temporarily to determine if your symptoms improve.  People who cannot tolerate milk products often manage better with yogurt that contains a <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> culture or lactose-reduced products, such as Lactaid milk or acidophilus milk.  Ask your nutritionist about Lactaid pills or drops (a natural source of the lactase enzyme that digests the milk product for you) to reduce bloating, cramps and diarrhea.  If you cannot digest lactose-reduced products, try fortified soymilk or liquid  nutritional supplements.
<li>Avoid greasy or fried food because these may aggravate diarrhea.  You may need to eat less fat if your diarrhea results from fat malabsorption.  If this is the case, choose lean meats, and avoid adding extra fat to food.  Certain nutritional supplements are lactose-free and low in fat, such as Lipisorb or Vivonex Plus.  To improve the flavor of these powdered supplements, add them to lemonade, juices or nectars.
<li>Avoid eating bran-type fiber in food, including raw fruits and vegetables, seeds, nuts, whole grains and corn.
<dt>Soluble fiber (pectins and gums) can help to reduce symptoms of diarrhea.  Food high in soluble fiber include oatmeal, mashed beans, tofu, applesauce and cooked pears.
<dt>If you have problems digesting food with roughage, choose low-fiber food, such as cooked meats, tofu, canned fruits and vegetables without skins, ripe bananas, mangoes, papayas, applesauce, white rice, couscous, millet, white bread toast or crackers, which are especially good to help control diarrhea.
<li>Ask your physician about anti-diarrheal medications, such as: Imodium, Lomotil or Paregoric.  The medication will vary depending on the cause of your diarrhea.  A tablespoon of Metamucil mixed with juice may help to control diarrhea because it contains soluble fiber which can promote stool bulking as well as prevent constipation.
<li>Avoid eating food that may cause cramps or bloating, such as apples, beans, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, onions, green peppers, beer and spicy food.
<li>Choose food and fluids that are high in potassium, a mineral that you lose with diarrhea.  Good food sources of potassium are bananas, raisins, potatoes, fish, tomatoes, chicken, meat and cooked beans.  High potassium fluids include orange juice, apricot, mango and peach nectars, V-8 juice and Gatorade.
</ul>

<p><a name="drinks"><b>Healthy Drinks from a Blender</b></a><br>
When you are HIV positive, there may be some days that you do not feel like eating.  You may have sores in your mouth or throat that make chewing or swallowing difficult.  You may even have diarrhea when you drink milk products.  These <a href="recipes.html">recipes</a> can help you make low-lactose or dairy-free drinks that are high in calories and protein so that you will be able to maintain your weight when you have eating and digestive problems.  To prepare each recipe, combine the ingredients at high speed in a blender or food processor for one to two minutes until smooth.  Add different types of fruit and flavoring so that you do not get tired of any one recipe. </p>

<p><a name="Consejos"><b>Consejos de Alimentaci&oacute;n para el VIH</b></a><br>

Existe una gran relaci&oacute;n entre lo que usted come y la habilidad de su sistema inmunol&oacute;gico para combatir enfermedades.  El comer alimentos saludables es especialmente importante para aumentar sus fuerzas f&iacute;sicas para que usted pueda disfrutar de la vida lo m&aacute;s normalmente posible cuando usted es VIH positivo. <b> La buena nutrici&oacute;n es una coterapia</b> que le puede ayudar a llevar al m&aacute;ximo el manejo m&eacute;dico del VIH.  Una nutrici&oacute;n agresiva puede prevenir o demorar la p&eacute;rdida de sus m&uacute;sculos. Este es un proceso que se llama desgaste VIH.  Los estudios demuestran que su salud nutricional es un factor importante que influye en la sobrevivencia al VIH.  Actualmente no hay cura para el VIH/SIDA, pero <b>usted puede afectar el proceso de la enfermedad y mejorar la calidad de su vida manteniendo una actitud positiva y un estilo de vida saludable. </b>Algunos de los cambios que usted puede hacer para tener un estilo de vida saludable incluyen:</p>

<ol>
<li>seguir la intervenci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica apropiada para tratar las infecciones;
<li>escoger alimentos saludables; 
<li>manejar las tensiones de una manera positiva; 
<li>hacer ejercicios en forma regular, preferiblemente con pesas;  
<li>integrar las terapias naturales y otras terapias alternativas en el manejo de su plan de salud.  
</ol>

<p>Todas estas terapias trabajan juntas para ayudar a su sistema inmunol&oacute;gico a combatir el VIH.</p>

<p>Las personas con VIH/SIDA tienden a perder musculatura y las reservas de prote&iacute;nas junto con diferentes cantidades de grasa corporal.  Hay tres razones principales por las cuales usted puede perder peso, experimentar p&eacute;rdida de los m&uacute;sculos y desarrollar malnutrici&oacute;n relacionada al VIH.  Si tiene poco apetito, es posible que no est&eacute; comiendo suficientes  prote&iacute;nas, calor&iacute;as, vitaminas y minerales que su cuerpo necesita; el metabolismo de su cuerpo se acelera cuando hay infecciones, y por esto, usted necesita calor&iacute;as y prote&iacute;nas adicionales en sus comidas para mantener su peso; y si usted tiene diarrea cr&oacute;nica, su cuerpo pierde calor&iacute;as, prote&iacute;nas, vitaminas y minerales.</p>
<p>Su tejido muscular es muy importante para mantenerlo a usted fuerte, mantener las funciones del cuerpo y ayudarle a procesar los medicamentos.  <b>Una meta nutricional fundamental para las personas con VIH es mantener o aumentar el peso muscular. </b> Puede hacer esto ingiriendo alimentos y tomando l&iacute;quidos altos en calor&iacute;as para que su cuerpo no use su tejido muscular para extraer energ&iacute;a durante las infecciones.  Este tipo de alimentaci&oacute;n le da a su cuerpo energ&iacute;a: almidones o carbohidratos complejos, az&uacute;cares simples y grasas.  Usted tambi&eacute;n necesita alimentos que le puedan proveer a su cuerpo con prote&iacute;nas para poder aumentar y mantener su musculatura.  Puede escoger una combinaci&oacute;n de fuentes de prote&iacute;na animal o una combinaci&oacute;n de prote&iacute;nas vegetales que se puedan complementar, dependiendo de su preferencia.  Tambi&eacute;n necesitar&aacute; hacer ejercicios diarios y repetitivos para aumentar la fuerza muscular.</p>

<p>Es bien importante el comer peque&ntilde;as cantidades durante el d&iacute;a, aunque usted no sienta deseos de comer.  Un plan de comidas alto en prote&iacute;nas, <b>alto en calor&iacute;as, que incluya una variedad de  carbohidratos complejos, y que incluya cantidades moderadas de grasas, es lo mejor para prevenir el desgaste muscular con el VIH. </b>Esto puede cambiar si usted tiene s&iacute;ntomas espec&iacute;ficos o alg&uacute;n otro problema m&eacute;dico. Su nutricionista o m&eacute;dico le pueden ayudar a modificar sus h&aacute;bitos de alimentaci&oacute;n si tiene alg&uacute;n s&iacute;ntoma en espec&iacute;fico. Esta gu&iacute;a le provee a usted consejos para aumentar al m&aacute;ximo su ingesta de prote&iacute;na y energ&iacute;a para poder ganar un buen peso.  En adici&oacute;n, le provee recomendaciones para tomar suplementos de vitaminas y minerales, sugerencias para el manejo de problemas nutricionales que le pueden afectar en su habilidad de comer, y tambi&eacute;n le provee consejos b&aacute;sicos para el manejo seguro de sus comidas.</p>

<p><a name="Calor&iacute;as"><b>Recomendaciones Para un Plan de Comidas Alto en Calor&iacute;as</b></a><br>
Es importante que usted coma suficientes calor&iacute;as cuando es VIH positivo, porque el VIH aumenta las necesidades de energ&iacute;a.  Una calor&iacute;a es una medida de la energ&iacute;a que nos proveen los alimentos.  Es recomendable ingerir alimentos altos en calor&iacute;as (energ&iacute;a).  Para esto, usted debe proveerle a su cuerpo con muchos alimentos altos en calor&iacute;as que se llaman<b> carbohidratos complejos </b>o <b>almidones</b>, incluyendo: pan y cereales de grano &iacute;ntegro, pastas, papas y arroz.  Las frutas, los vegetales y las az&uacute;cares simples le dan a su cuerpo energ&iacute;a r&aacute;pida.  Las grasas le dan calor&iacute;as, pero no son buenas fuentes de energ&iacute;a para sus m&uacute;sculos. Las grasas le dan energ&iacute;a adicional para ser utilizada, y para aumentar la reserva de grasa corporal.  Si usted no come suficientes calor&iacute;as a trav&eacute;s de los carbohidratos, su cuerpo gastar&aacute; sus m&uacute;sculos para obtener energ&iacute;a.  Usted pudiera no sentir apetito cuando est&aacute; enfermo mientras nota que est&aacute; perdiendo peso poco a poco.  Es bien importante el comer peque&ntilde;as cantidades de alimentos durante el d&iacute;a a&uacute;n si no tiene hambre.</p>

<p><b>Para aumentar su ingesta de calor&iacute;as:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Coma seis peque&ntilde;as comidas durante el d&iacute;a (8:30 a.m. desayuno, 10:00 a.m. merienda, 12:30 p.m. almuerzo, 3:00 p.m. merienda, 5:30 p.m. cena, 7:30 p.m. merienda.)
<li>Tenga meriendas cerca de su cama o al lado del televisor.
<li>Empaque alimentos que no sean perecederos para merendar cuando est&eacute; fuera de su casa. 
<li>Haga ejercicios livianos antes de comer para aumentar su apetito.
</ul>

<p><b>Los carbohidratos complejos o almidones son el mejor tipo de energ&iacute;a para formar y mantener el tejido muscular.  Consuma porciones abundantes de:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pastas de trigo (macarrones enriquecidos, espaguetis o fideos).
<li>Arroz (integral o blanco), cebada.
<li>Viandas (yuca, batata, pl&aacute;tanos verdes y maduros, papas, pana.) 
<li>Avena; cremas de ma&iacute;z, trigo y arroz; farina;"grits" y cereales secos.
<li>Panes, tortillas, molletes, panecillos , galletas, panqueques y bu&ntilde;uelos dulces ("waffles").Habichuelas rojas, blancas, rositas, lentejas, frijoles negros, garbanzos y gandules (cocidos).
</ul>

<p><b>Las az&uacute;cares simples le dan energ&iacute;a adicional para aumentar el peso muscular y la grasa corporal.  Para energ&iacute;a adicional:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Meriende con frutas frescas, frutas secas como pasas, d&aacute;tiles, melocotones, pi&ntilde;a, papaya y ciruelas.
<li>A&ntilde;ada jalea, mermelada, miel, y alm&iacute;bar a los cereales calientes y fr&iacute;os, panqueques y bu&ntilde;uelos dulces.
<li>A&ntilde;ada miel, az&uacute;car, melaza y alm&iacute;bar (sirop) a los batidos, t&eacute; caliente o fr&iacute;o, "Kool-Aid" y limonada.
<li>A&ntilde;ada frutas frescas o secas y alm&iacute;bar a los helados y el yogur.  Meriende con bizcochos, pasteles dulces y galletitas despu&eacute;s de o entre comidas.
</ul>

<p><b>Las grasas le dan energ&iacute;a adicional para utilizar y tambi&eacute;n para aumentar la grasa corporal.  Consuma cantidades moderadas.</b></p>

<ul>
<li>A&ntilde;ada mantequilla, margarina, crema agria, queso crema y mantequilla de man&iacute; a los emparedados, galletas, panqueques, bu&ntilde;uelos dulces y el cereal caliente.
<li>A&ntilde;ada salsa o "gravy" a la carne, el pollo, pavo, papas majadas o papas horneadas.
<li>A&ntilde;ada crema agria, queso crema, queso rallado, mantequilla o margarina a las papas majadas u horneadas. 
<li>A&ntilde;ada aguacate, aceitunas y aderezo a las ensaladas.
<li>Si usted no tiene problema con intolerancia a la lactosa, a&ntilde;ada leche condensada, leche &iacute;ntegra y crema a la granola y los cereales calientes y fr&iacute;os. 
</ul>

<p><a name="Prote&iacute;nas"><b>Gu&iacute;a Para un Plan de Comidas alto en Prote&iacute;nas</b></a><br>
Consumir suficientes prote&iacute;nas es sumamente importante cuando su cuerpo est&aacute; combatiendo infecciones o recuper&aacute;ndose de &eacute;stas.  Las prote&iacute;nas le ayudan a construir el tejido muscular y ayudan a su sistema inmunol&oacute;gico a combatir infecciones.  Usted puede obtener las prote&iacute;nas por medio de fuentes animales o vegetales.  Consuma cantidades abundantes de prote&iacute;nas en cada comida.  Estas fuentes incluyen:</p>

<p><b>Fuentes de Prote&iacute;na Animal</b></p>

<ul>
<li>pescado, pollo, pavo, carnes rojas (ternera, oveja, res, cerdo, conejo y venado) y &oacute;rganos (h&iacute;gados y mollejas)
<li>huevos, queso, productos l&aacute;cteos
</ul>

<p><b>Fuentes de Prote&iacute;na Vegetal</b></p>

<ul>
<li>habichuelas cocidas (rojas, frijoles negros, soyas, gandules y garbanzos)
<li>guisantes verdes y lentejas
<li>tof&uacute;, "tempeh", "miso", "seitan" (gluten de trigo)leche de soya fortificada, (leche de arroz, leche de almendra o cajil, a&ntilde;adi&eacute;ndole prote&iacute;na en polvo)
<li>nueces (nueces de nogal, pacanas, cajil, almendras, avellanas, nueces de Brazil) y mantequilla de nueces (de man&iacute; o de cajil)
<li>semillas (de calabaza o de s&eacute;samo) y mantequilla de semillas (tahini)
</ul>

<p><b>Sugerencias para aumentar las prote&iacute;nas en sus comidas:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Use huevos duros para hacer emparedados de ensalada; a&ntilde;ada pedazos de huevo duro a sus ensaladas; consuma postres tales como galletitas, flanes, pudines, y bizcochos.  A&ntilde;ada "eggbeaters" o prote&iacute;na en polvo a sus batidas y use tostadas francesas para sus emparedados.
<li>A&ntilde;ada pedacitos de carne, pollo o pavo a sus sopas, ensaladas o salsas.
<li>A&ntilde;ada at&uacute;n, salm&oacute;n, camarones o cangrejos a sus guisos y ensaladas.
<li>Ralle queso y an&aacute;daselo a las salsas, sopas, tortillas, papas asadas y vegetales al vapor; a&ntilde;ada pedacitos de queso a sus ensaladas de hojas verdes, ensalada de pollo o de papa; pruebe el reques&oacute;n con frutas, ensaladas verdes o mezclado en sus guisos o con sus pastas al horno. El queso con galletas es una buena merienda entre comidas.  Tambi&eacute;n puede comer queso con pan o con frutas.
<li>Use leche, "Lactaid" o leche de soya fortificada en sus cereales calientes, sopas a la crema o batidas de frutas.  Coma yogur con cereales secos o frutas.  Compre yogur que contenga un cultivo activo de "L. acidophilus."  El "acidophilus" es una buena bacteria que reduce la cantidad de lactosa en el yogur para que usted lo pueda digerir m&aacute;s f&aacute;cilmente que la leche regular, especialmente si usted es intolerante a la lactosa.  Si usted tiene diarrea como resultado de sus antibi&oacute;ticos, el yogur le ayuda a reducir la diarrea.
<li>Untele mantequilla de man&iacute; o pistacho al pan, tostadas, galletas, frutas frescas o vegetales crudos.
<li>A&ntilde;ada habichuelas a las sopas y ensaladas; &uacute;ntele habichuelas majadas al pan, galletas o vegetales crudos; a&ntilde;ada tof&uacute; o prote&iacute;na vegetal a las sopas, ensaladas o guisados.
</ul>

<p><a name="Vitam&iacute;nicos y Minerales"><b>Los Suplementos Vitam&iacute;nicos y Minerales</b></a><br>
<b>Las vitaminas</b> y <b>los minerales </b>son substancias que su cuerpo no puede fabricar pero que necesita en peque&ntilde;as cantidades para sobrevivir.  Tambi&eacute;n se le conocen como <b>micronutrientes</b>.  Las vitaminas y los minerales est&aacute;n envueltos en reacciones espec&iacute;ficas en su cuerpo y se necesitan tomar con las comidas porque tienen que interactuar con las prote&iacute;nas, las grasas y los carbohidratos para trabajar efic&aacute;zmente.  Las personas saludables que comen una variedad de alimentos a diario usualmente no necesitan tomar un suplemento de multivitamina y minerales porque reciben lo que necesitan de lo que comen.  Si usted es VIH positivo o tiene el SIDA, usted necesita m&aacute;s que lo que las comidas le pueden proveer, especialmente si usted tiene poco apetito y no come las tres comidas, si su cuerpo est&aacute; luchando contra las infecciones, o si usted tiene diarrea cr&oacute;nica.</p>

<p>Las deficiencias espec&iacute;ficas de vitaminas y minerales pueden suprimir la inmunidad si usted no consume suficientes calor&iacute;as y prote&iacute;nas.  Estas incluyen: vitamina A, vitamina B6, vitamina C, zinc, selenio, hierro y cobre. 
<b>Si usted es VIH positivo y no tiene s&iacute;ntomas</b>, debe tomar un suplemento multivitam&iacute;nico con minerales diario que sea por lo menos 100% de las Recomendaciones Dietarias de los E.E.U.U. (USRDA).  El USRDA es una norma fijada por el gobierno sobre las cantidades de nutrientes que las personas necesitan para prevenir deficiencias y mantener la salud.  Puede escoger una marqua reconocida, tal como<b> "Centrum"</b> o <b>"Theragran-M." </b> Usted puede<b> pedirle a su m&eacute;dico que le recete un suplemento multivitam&iacute;nico con minerales que sea cubierto por "Medicaid" o "ADAP-PLUS."  </b>Si usted quiere protecci&oacute;n adicional puede seleccionar un suplemento multivitam&iacute;nico con minerales que contenga niveles m&aacute;s altos que los que el USRDA establece. Este necesitar&aacute; comprarlo usted mismo porque actualmente no es reembolsable.  Revise el contenido para asegurarse que no tome dosis muy altas que le puedan causar efectos secundarios.  Ponga atenci&oacute;n especial a su dosis de vitamina A (retinol), vitamina D, B6, zinc, selenio, hierro y cobre. </p>

<p><b>Si usted es VIH positivo y sintom&aacute;tico</b>, usted se beneficiar&iacute;a al tomar dos suplementos multivitam&iacute;nicos con minerales diariamente con sus comidas.  Las investigaciones han demostrado que hay ciertas vitaminas y minerales a los cuales usted puede desarollar deficiencias mientras que el VIH sigue progresando.  Estas incluyen: vitamina B12, folato, vitamina B6, zinc y selenio.  Usted puede pedirle a su m&eacute;dico que coteje los niveles de estas vitaminas y minerales en el suero o en la sangre en el momento en que a usted se le hace un examen "CBC."  De esta manera podr&aacute; determinar si necesita una dosis m&aacute;s alta de vitaminas y minerales espec&iacute;ficos que corrijan las deficiencias existentes.  Algunas personas prefieren tomar dosis terape&uacute;ticas de vitaminas y minerales individuales para prevenir deficiencias o para aumentar el funcionamiento inmunol&oacute;gico. Evidencia reciente sugiere que dosis terap&eacute;uticas de los antioxidantes beta caroteno, vitamina E y vitamina C pueden reducir los niveles de radicales libres producidos por la infecci&oacute;n VIH.  Si usted decide hacer &eacute;sto, las dosis siguientes son recomendadas como seguras, no obstante, debe hacerlo bajo la supervisi&oacute;n de su m&eacute;dico y equipo de salud.</p>

<p><b>La siguiente informaci&oacute;n  le puede ayudar si usted tiene una deficiencia existente: si usted desarolla una deficiencia de vitamina B12, </b>usted puede experimentar una demencia relacionada a la nutrici&oacute;n y una neuropat&iacute;a adem&aacute;s de un tipo de anemia en la cual sus c&eacute;lulas rojas de la sangre se ponen grandes.  Si su m&eacute;dico ha determinado que usted tiene una deficiencia, usted puede recibir una dosis oral de 500-1000 microgramos diarios o un inyecci&oacute;n de vitamina B12 en su m&uacute;sculo en una dosis de 1000 mcg por mes.</p>

<p><b>Si usted desarolla una deficiencia de folato</b>, usted puede experimentar un tipo de anemia similar a la relacionada a la  vitamina B12 en la cual sus c&eacute;lulas rojas de la sangre se ponen grandes.  Si su m&eacute;dico ha determinado que usted tiene una deficiencia, usted puede recibir una dosis terape&uacute;tica de 500-1000 microgramos diarios.  Es importante equilibrar su suplemento de folato con un suplemento de vitamina B12.  Usted puede esconder una deficiencia de vitamina B12 si toma solamente folato.  De esta manera puede corregir la anemia pero a&uacute;n tener los s&iacute;ntomas relacionados con la falta de vitamina B12.</p>

<p><b>Si usted desarolla una deficiencia de vitamina B6, </b>usted puede experimentar una neuropat&iacute;a relacionada a la nutrici&oacute;n que incluye el perder sensibilidad en los dedos de las manos y de los pies.  Si su m&eacute;dico ha determinado que usted tiene una deficiencia, usted puede recibir una dosis oral de 50 miligramos diarios.  Es importante tomar un suplemento de vitamina B6 de 50 miligramos diarios si usted est&aacute; tomando un medicamento para la tuberculosis que se llama "Isoniazid" (INH).  Cuando usted toma INH su cuerpo pierde vitamina B6.  Si usted no toma el suplemento de vitamina B6 con el INH a diario, usted puede desarollar una neuropat&iacute;a.  Si usted toma una dosis oral de m&aacute;s de 100 miligramos diarios, su sistema nervioso puede experimentar efectos secundarios da&ntilde;inos.</p>

<p><b>Si usted desarolla una deficiencia de zinc</b>, posiblemente su sistema inmunol&oacute;gico pudiera no estar funcionando bien y le puede tomar mas tiempo recupararse de las infecciones.  Si su m&eacute;dico ha determinado que usted tiene una deficiencia de zinc, usted puede recibir una dosis oral de 50-75 miligramos diarios.  Si usted tiene diarrea cr&oacute;nica, su m&eacute;dico puede darle un suplemento de zinc a trav&eacute;s de inyecciones.  Si toma una dosis oral de m&aacute;s de 300 miligramos diarios, pudiera usted por el contrario  estar suprimiendo su funci&oacute;n inmunol&oacute;gica.</p>

<p><b>Si usted desarolla una deficiencia de selenio,  </b>su sistema inmunol&oacute;gico pudiera no estar funcionando bien  y usted podr&iacute;a desarollar problemas con el coraz&oacute;n.  Si su m&eacute;dico ha determinado que usted tiene una deficiencia, usted puede recibir una dosis terape&uacute;tica de 100-200 microgramos diarios.  Si usted toma una dosis oral de m&aacute;s de 1 miligramo diario, su sistema nervioso puede experimentar efectos secundarios da&ntilde;inos.</p>

<p><b>Antioxidantes</b><br>
Ciertas vitaminas y minerales pueden funcionar como antioxidantes en el cuerpo.  Estos incluyen: vitamina C, vitamina E, beta caroteno y selenio.  Un <b>antioxidante</b> actua como un "pac-man" en el cuerpo porque va "comiendo" los radicales libres.  Un radical libre es una substancia que es producida por su cuerpo cuando esta en estr&eacute;s,la que se pega a una substancia m&aacute;s d&eacute;bil y causa da&ntilde;o a la c&eacute;lula.  Los antioxidantes se pegan con fuerza a los radicales libres para removerlos del cuerpo para que no le hagan da&ntilde;o a las c&eacute;lulas.  Hay investigaciones que apoyan la teor&iacute;a de que las personas con VIH producen m&aacute;s radicales libres, lo cual puede acelerar el progreso al SIDA.  Se est&aacute;n haciendo investigaciones sobre otras substancias que tambi&eacute;n pueden actuar como antioxidantes, por ejemplo: "N-acteyl cysteine" (NAC) y "glutathione".  Todav&iacute;a no hay evidencia clara de que estos suplementos son beneficiosos en dosis altas pero usted puede escoger tomarlos despu&eacute;s de considerar los beneficios y los da&ntilde;os potenciales que estos pueden ocasionarle a su cuerpo.</p>

<p><a name="L&iacute;quidos"><b>L&iacute;quidos</b></a><br>
El beber suficientes l&iacute;quidos es indispensable cuando usted es VIH positivo.  Los l&iacute;quidos le ayudan a prevenir que usted se deshidrate, especialmente cuando usted est&aacute; tomando muchos medicamentos.  Su cuerpo necesita muchos l&iacute;quidos para poder limpiarse  de los residuos de medicamentos que ha utilizado . Si usted est&aacute; teniendo dificultad para mantener su peso, tome <b>l&iacute;quidos altos en calor&iacute;as</b> (jugos, n&eacute;ctares, ponche de frutas, t&eacute; fr&iacute;o, limonada, "ginger ale", sodas, "Gatorade" y "Kool-Aid") y l&iacute;quidos<b> altos en calor&iacute;as y prote&iacute;nas</b> (leche, leche batida, leche "Lactaid," leche de soya fortificada, "Ensure Plus," "Resource Plus," "Sustacal" y "Nutrament") en vez de agua.  Tome por lo menos ocho vasos de l&iacute;quidos diarios. Beba m&aacute;s l&iacute;quidos si usted est&aacute; tomando muchos medicamentos.  Usted necesitar&aacute; tomar m&aacute;s si su boca o lengua se resecan.  Evite tomar bebidas que contengan cafe&iacute;na, especialmente si usted tiene diarrea, porque estos hacen que su cuerpo necesite m&aacute;s l&iacute;quidos.  Bebidas que contienen cafe&iacute;na incluyen: caf&eacute;, t&eacute; negro y algunos tipos de sodas.  Evite el tomar alcohol porque es bajo en nutrientes y tambi&eacute;n le puede deshidratar.</p>

<p>Algunos g&eacute;rmenes se pueden transmitir a trav&eacute;s del agua. Estos le pueden enfermar si su contaje CD4 es menos de 200 c&eacute;lulas/mm3. <i> <a href="../../network/lared/simple/cripto.html">Criptosporidiosis</a>, Microsporidiosis </i>y  "<i><a href="../../network/simple/mac.html"> Mycobacterium avium</i> complex"</a> (MAC) pueden ser transmitidos a trav&eacute;s del agua y causar s&iacute;ntomas similares al flu, incluyendo: dolor de est&oacute;mago, diarrea, fiebre, n&aacute;useas y p&eacute;rdida de peso.  <b>Si toma agua</b>, compre agua carbonatada embotellada (seltzer), agua destilada o agua filtrada.  Si toma agua de la llave, hi&eacute;rvala por cinco minutos para matar los g&eacute;rmenes y d&eacute;jela enfriar antes de usarla en t&eacute; frio, limonada, "Kool-Aid" o para diluir jugos de frutas concentrados. Los jugos de frutas embotellados son m&aacute;s seguros para tomar si son pasteurizados.</p>
<p><b>El resecamiento de la boca </b>puede ocurrir como resultado de no tomar suficientes l&iacute;quidos o como efecto de tomar muchos medicamentos.  Adem&aacute;s de tomar suficientes l&iacute;quidos, las sugerencias siguientes le pueden ayudar a manejar este problema:</p>

<ul>
<li>use salsa adicional, mantequilla, yogur o aderezo para mojar sus alimentos.
<li>moje su pan o galletas en su sopa, leche, jugo o chocolate caliente.
<li>chupe dulce sin az&uacute;car o dulces agrios, helados, hielo o goma de mascar para estimular la salivaci&oacute;n.
<li>duerma con un humidificador en su dormitorio y con l&iacute;quidos cerca de su cama para que tome por las noches si se siente con sed.
</ul>

<p><b>El estre&ntilde;imiento </b>puede ocurrir como resultado de no tomar suficientes l&iacute;quidos, no comer suficientes alimentos y fibra dietaria y no hacer ejercicio.  El estre&ntilde;imiento puede ser causado por algunos medicamentos, especialmente la metadona, o medicamentos para el dolor hechos con narc&oacute;ticos.  Adem&aacute;s de tomar m&aacute;s l&iacute;quidos, las sugerencias siguientes le pueden ayudar a manejar este problema:</p>

<ul>
<li>consuma comidas altas en fibras insolubles: cereales y panes de grano &iacute;ntegro, frutas y vegetales frescos, habichuelas y garbanzos cocidos, nueces y semillas.
<li>incorpore regularmente ejercicios aer&oacute;bicos a su rutina diaria.
<li>preg&uacute;ntele a su doctor por medicamentos para el estre&ntilde;imiento.
</ul>

<p><a name="Los Alimentos"><b>Precauciones Con Los Alimentos</b></a><br>
Usted deber&aacute; tomar precauciones con los alimentos cuando su sistema inmunul&oacute;gico este debilitado por el VIH.  Los g&eacute;rmenes pueden ser transmitidos a usted a trav&eacute;s de los alimentos que no est&aacute;n completamente cocidos o manejados apropiadamente.  Una enfermedad transmitida por los alimentos lo puede enfermar mucho m&aacute;s.  Los s&iacute;ntomas de intoxicaci&oacute;n alimentaria pueden incluir fiebre, na&uacute;seas, v&oacute;mitos, calambres y diarrea. Las recomendaciones siguientes le pueden ayudar a protegerse de la intoxicaci&oacute;n alimentaria cuando usted est&aacute; preparando o almacenando los alimentos.</p>

<p><b>Al Preparar Las Comidas</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Lave bien las frutas y los vegetales con agua tibia y un detergente suave para platos utilizando un cepillo con cerdas suaves.  Tambi&eacute;n puede mezclar media taza de jugo de lim&oacute;n y un gal&oacute;n de agua tibia para enjuagarlos, o remover la c&aacute;scara de las frutas y vegetales antes de comerlos.
<li>Cocine la carne, el pollo y el pescado hasta que est&eacute;n bien cocidos , hasta que no tengan nada de sangre. No coma la carne, el pollo, el pescado o los mariscos crudos incluyendo "sushi" o almejas cocidas al vapor.
<li>Descongele las carnes y los pollos en un plato en la nevera, no a la temperatura del ambiente.  Tome solamente la leche pasteurizada.  La leche o los productos l&aacute;cteos que no son pasteurizados pueden tener <i>salmonela</i> (bacterias).
<li> No use los huevos que tienen hendeduras en su c&aacute;scara.  Es importante hervirlos por lo menos cinco minutos o fre&iacute;rlos por un m&iacute;nimo de tres minutos por cada lado.  Evite los huevos que son escalfados ligeramente o cocidos solamente por un lado.  Evite tambi&eacute;n los alimentos que contienen huevos crudos o que no est&aacute;n completamente cocidos, tales como: mayonesa hecha en la casa, salsa holandesa, helados, ponche y batidas de huevo caseros, mezclas crudas de galletas y bizcochos y ensalada "Caesar".
<li>No coma quesos suaves como "Brie" y "Camembert."  Tire a la basura el queso que tiene hongo.
<li>No coma directamente de un recipiente de almacenaje porque las bacterias de la boca pueden hacer que el alimento se destruya m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido.  No sirva la comida con la misma cuchara con la que come.
<li>Haga una mezcla dilu&iacute;da de blanqueador, a&ntilde;adi&eacute;ndole 1-2 cucharadas de blanqueador por un gal&oacute;n de agua tibia.  Use esta mezcla para limpiar los utensilios de cocina y las tablas de cortar alimentos antes y despu&eacute;s de preparar sus comidas. Las tablas pl&aacute;sticas de cortar alimentos son m&aacute;s f&aacute;ciles de limpiar que las de  madera.
<li>L&aacute;vese las manos con agua tibia y jab&oacute;n antes y despu&eacute;s de preparar las comidas.
</ul>

<p><b>Al Almacenar los Alimentos </b></p>

<ul>
<li>Coloque en la nevera el alimento que no va a consumir inmediatamente.
<li>Si est&aacute; preparando una cantidad grande de alimentos, sep&aacute;relos en recipientes peque&ntilde;os y p&oacute;ngalos en la nevera para que puedan enfriarse m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido y reducir el crecimiento de bacterias.
<li>Tape el alimento bien con una envoltura pl&aacute;stica o gu&aacute;rdelo en recipientes herm&eacute;ticos para mantenerlo fresco.
<li>No permita que el agua del alimento que est&aacute; descongelando toque otro alimento en la nevera.
<li>Refrigere todos los aceites para cocinar y para las ensaladas en la nevera.  Los aceites pueden ponerse rancios cuando se guardan por mucho tiempo a la temperatura del ambiente.
<li>No coma los sobrantes que han estado almacenados en la nevera por m&aacute;s de dos d&iacute;as.
<li>No consuma alimentos despu&eacute;s del d&iacute;a de expiraci&oacute;n que est&aacute; escrito en el recipiente.  
</ul>

<p><a name="Poco Apetito"><b>Poco Apetito</b></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Consuma seis comidas peque&ntilde;as diarias (8:30 a.m. desayuno, 10:00 a.m. merienda, 12:30 p.m. almuerzo, 3:00 p.m. merienda, 5:30 p.m. cena, 7:30 p.m. merienda).
<li>Tenga meriendas cerca de su cama o al lado del televisor en su casa o apartamento.
<li>Haga ejercicios livianos, ejercicios de estiramiento, y ejercicios de respiraci&oacute;n profunda antes de comer.
<li>Coma sus alimentos favoritos, no importa si es solamente una cantidad peque&ntilde;a.
<li>Tome un suplemento nutricional o una batida de fruta preparada en la casa, en vez de no comer una de sus comidas.
<li>Prepare alimentos en grandes cantidades y cong&eacute;lelos en envases del tama&ntilde;o de una porci&oacute;n.
<li>Preg&uacute;ntele a su m&eacute;dico o nutricionista con respecto a los medicamentos que le pueden estimular su apetito incluyendo: "Marinol", "Periactin" y "Megace".
</ul>

<p><a name="N&aacute;useas y V&oacute;mitos"><b>N&aacute;useas y V&oacute;mitos</b></a><br>
Las n&aacute;useas y los v&oacute;mitos pueden ser el resultado de alguna infecci&oacute;n o de algunos tratamientos.  Las siguientes sugerencias pueden ayudarle a manejar los s&iacute;ntomas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consuma peque&ntilde;as comidas con frecuencia durante el d&iacute;a en vez de dos o tr&eacute;s comidas grandes y tome l&iacute;quidos altos en calor&iacute;as media hora despu&eacute;s de comer.
<li>No consuma los alimentos s&oacute;lidos con los l&iacute;quidos en la misma comida.  Es preferible esperar por lo menos una hora entre uno y otro.
<li>Evite el comer alimentos grasosos, fritos, o con muchas especias (picante).  En su lugar, escoja alimentos fr&iacute;os y con pocas especias picantes.
<li>Escoja alimentos secos como los cereales en cajas, galletitas, y tostadas "melbas".  Usted puede tener estos al lado de su cama o su silla favorita para que est&eacute;n a su alcance.
<li>Consuma alimentos salados como galletitas, "pretzels" y palomitas de ma&iacute;z ("popcorn") sin mantequilla para reducir las n&aacute;useas.
<li>No se acueste hasta por lo menos una hora despu&eacute;s de comer.  Espere a digerir los alimentos antes de dormirse.Consuma los alimentos fr&iacute;os o a la temperatura del ambiente.  Los alimentos calientes pueden empeorar las n&aacute;useas.
<li>Evite comer sus alimentos favoritos cuando est&aacute; enfermo.  Puede que lleguen a no gustarle porque los asocia con el sentirse con n&aacute;useas.  Si el olor de las  comidas le da n&aacute;useas, p&iacute;dale a otra persona que le cocine y no se acerque a la cocina mientras  se le preparan los alimentos.
<li>Una taza de t&eacute; de hierbas con miel (por ejemplo, menta o manzanilla), o mascar la ra&iacute;z del jengibre fresco a veces puede calmar un est&oacute;mago con n&aacute;useas.
<li>Preg&uacute;ntele a su m&eacute;dico acerca de alg&uacute;n medicamento para reducir las n&aacute;useas, por ejemplo "Compazine", "Reglan" o "Marinol".  Si un medicamento no le trabaja bien, su m&eacute;dico puede darle otro m&aacute;s efectivo.  Tome el medicamento media hora antes de comer.
</ul>

<p><a name="Dolor de Boca"><b>Dolor de Boca</b></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Evite fumar cigarillos o tomar alcohol porque pueden irritarle la parte interior de su boca.
<li>Consuma alimentos fr&iacute;os para adormecer sus papilas del gusto: sorbete, helados de frutas, yogur congelado.
<li>Consuma alimentos suaves y blandos incluyendo: compota de manzana, avena, crema de ma&iacute;z, crema de trigo, sopas a la  crema, natillas, pud&iacute;n, carnes cocidas y huevos duros hervidos y majados.
<li>Tome jugos y n&eacute;ctares sin &aacute;cidos.  Evite los alimentos con &aacute;cidos (por ejemplo, jugos c&iacute;tricos, salsa de tomate y vinagre), alimentos salados y alimentos con especias (picantes).
<li>Evite comer alimentos muy calientes y tomar bebidas carbonatadas que puedan irritar las &uacute;lceras bucales.  Consuma alimentos tibios en vez de calientes.
</ul>

<p><a name="Dolor al Tragar"><b>Dolor al Tragar</b></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Use un sorbeto para tomar y una taza o un vaso en vez de un plato para comer sopas. Incline su cabeza hacia atr&aacute;s para tragar m&aacute;s f&aacute;cilmente.
<li>Escoja almientos de textura suave (avena, crema de trigo, frutas enlatadas, reques&oacute;n, yogur, pud&iacute;n o flan).  Lic&uacute;e los alimentos en una licuadora o procesador de alimentos si usted no puede tolerar la textura suave.
<li>Consuma los alimentos a la temperatura del ambiente.  Evite el comer alimentos muy calientes o muy fr&iacute;os.
<li>Pruebe una variedad de suplementos nutricionales l&iacute;quidos altos en calor&iacute;as y prote&iacute;nas, adem&aacute;s de los alimentos suaves o licuados, por ejemplo: "Ensure Plus", "Sustacal", "Resource Plus" , "Nutrament" y "Nutren 2.0".  Usted tiene que determinar lo que le sabe bien.  Pruebe mezclando en una licuadora las frutas con sabores tales como vainilla y fresa o mezcle un guineo con el sabor del chocolate.  Si est&aacute; bajo peso, preg&uacute;ntele a su nutricionista, m&eacute;dico o trabajador social c&oacute;mo obtener suplementos nutricionales a trav&eacute;s de Medicaid.
</ul>

<p><a name="Paladar"><b>Cambios en el Paladar</b></a><br>
Algunas infecciones orales como "thrush" (hongo o candidiasis oral o del es&oacute;fago) y algunos medicamentos pueden afectarle sus papilas del gusto y el poder disfrutar de sus alimentos favoritos.  A consequencia de esto, usted pudiera necesitar comer alimentos pocos sazonados.  Por el contrario, quiz&aacute; usted desarrolle un sabor met&aacute;lico en la boca y requiera de alimentos agrios para ayudar a disminuirlo.  Las sugerencias siguientes le pueden ayudar cuando usted tiene cambios en el paladar:</p>

<ul>
<li>Antes de comer, enju&aacute;gese la boca con una mezcla de una cucharadita de agua oxigenada o bicarbonato de soda por taza de agua tibia destilada.  Enju&aacute;gese la boca pero no lo trague.  Tome su medicamento contra el hongo regularmente para prevenir infecciones de c&aacute;ndida oral o del es&oacute;fago si confronta este problema.
<li>Use un cepillo con cerdas suaves y una pasta de dientes con sabor para limpiar los dientes adem&aacute;s de la lengua antes y despu&eacute;s de comer.
<li>Los alimentos agrios pueden ayudar a reducir el sabor met&aacute;lico.  Pruebe tomando jugo de naranja, ar&aacute;ndano agrio "cranberry", jugo de pi&ntilde;a y limonada.
<li>A&ntilde;ada vinagre, jugo de lim&oacute;n, encurtidos o salsa con condimento a sus alimentos.
<li>Ponga a marinar la carne, el pollo, pavo, pescado o tof&uacute; en vinagre, vino, aderezo, o salsa de soya.A&ntilde;ada hierbas frescas o secas a sus alimentos (romero, tomillo, albahaca, or&eacute;gano o comino).Pruebe alimentos con texturas diferentes (nueces picadas o semillas) para hacer sus comidas m&aacute;s interesantes.
<li>Consuma alimentos fr&iacute;os, por ejemplo: sorbete, helados de frutas y yogur congelado, para adormecer sus papilas del gusto.
</ul>

<p><a name="La Diarrea"><b>La Diarrea</b></a><br>
La diarrea puede ser el resultado de infecciones, medicamentos o cambios en sus intestinos.  El tipo y el grado de la diarrea pueden variar dependiendo de la causa y de su tolerancia a alimentos espec&iacute;ficos.  La diarrea puede resultar en la p&eacute;rdida de l&iacute;quidos y causar deshidrataci&oacute;n.  Las sugerencias siguientes le pueden ayudar a reducir los s&iacute;ntomas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tome suficientes l&iacute;quidos con calor&iacute;as para reemplazar lo que usted pierde con la diarrea cr&oacute;nica. Estos incluyen: jugos (de uva, ar&aacute;ndano agrio, jugo de naranja dilu&iacute;do) ponche de frutas, n&eacute;ctares (albaricoque, melocot&oacute;n, pera, mang&oacute; y guineo), t&eacute; fr&iacute;o, limonada, "Gatorade", "Kool-Aid" y suplementos  nutricionales l&iacute;quidos.  El agua no es lo mejor para tomar en grandes cantidades porque no le da calor&iacute;as o prote&iacute;nas.  Tome por lo menos ocho vasos de l&iacute;quidos altos en calor&iacute;as y prote&iacute;nas diarios.  Evite las bebidas alcoh&oacute;licas  y las que contengan cafe&iacute;na, incluyendo: caf&eacute;, t&eacute; negro, bebidas de chocolates y refrescos.  Tome los l&iacute;quidos a la temperatura del ambiente porque los l&iacute;quidos fr&iacute;os o calientes pueden empeorar su diarrea.
<li>Evite la leche o los productos l&aacute;cteos temporalmente para determinar si sus s&iacute;ntomas se mejoran.  Algunas personas que no pueden tolerar los productos l&aacute;cteos toleran muy bien el yogur que contiene el cultivo de bacterias<i> Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, o productos bajos en lactosa como la leche "Lactaid" o la leche "acidophilus."  Preg&uacute;ntele a su nutricionista acerca de las pastillas o gotas "Lactaid" (una fuente natural de la enzima lactasa que digiere los productos l&aacute;cteos para usted) para reducir los s&iacute;ntomas de gases, calambres y diarrea.  Si usted no puede digerir productos bajos en lactosa, pruebe la leche de soya fortificada o los suplementos nutricionales l&iacute;quidos.
<li>Evite los alimentos grasosos o fritos porque estos pueden empeorar la diarrea.  Posiblemente usted necesitar&aacute; seguir una dieta baja en grasas si su diarrea es el resultado de la malabsorci&oacute;n de &eacute;stas.  Si &eacute;ste es el caso, escoja las carnes sin grasas, y evite el a&ntilde;adir grasas a los alimentos.  Ciertos suplementos nutricionales en polvo no tienen lactosa y son bajos en grasas, como por ejemplo "Lipisorb" o " Vivonex Plus." Para mejorar el sabor de estos suplementos en polvo, a&ntilde;&aacute;daselos a la limonada, los jugos o los n&eacute;ctares.
<li>Evite el comer alimentos que contengan salvado ("bran"), incluyendo: frutas frescas y vegetales crudos, semillas, nueces, granos &iacute;ntegros y ma&iacute;z.  En cambio, ciertos tipos de fibra solubles (pectinas y gomas) pueden reducir los s&iacute;ntomas de diarrea.  Los alimentos altos en fibras solubles incluyen: avena, habichuelas majadas, tof&uacute;, compota de manzanas, peras cocidas.  Usted necesitar&aacute; determinar que es lo que usted puede tolerar.  Si usted tiene problemas en digerir todos los tipos de fibra, escoja alimentos bajos en fibra tales como: carnes cocidas, tof&uacute;, frutas enlatadas y vegetales sin la c&aacute;scara, guineos maduros, mang&oacute;, papayas, compota de manzanas, arroz blanco, cuscos, millo ("millet"), tostadas de pan blanco o galletas, los cuales le ayudar&aacute;n a controlar la diarrea.
<li>Preg&uacute;ntele a su m&eacute;dico con respecto a los medicamentos para controlar la diarrea, tales como: "Imodium", "Lomotil", o "Paregoric." El medicamento ser&aacute; diferente dependiendo de la causa de la misma.  Una cucharada de Metamucil mezclada con jugo le puede ayudar a controlar la diarrea porque contiene fibra soluble, la cual puede aumentar el bulto de las heces fecales y tambi&eacute;n puede prevenir el estre&ntilde;imiento.
<li>Evite ciertos alimentos que le pueden causar calambres o gases, como manzanas, habichuelas, repollo, br&eacute;col, colifor, col de Bruselas, cebollas, pimientos verdes, cerveza y alimentos con especias.
<li>Escoja alimentos y l&iacute;quidos que sean altos en potasio, un mineral que usted pierde cuando tiene diarrea.  Buenas fuentes de potasio incluyen: guineos, pasas, pescado, tomate, pollo, carnes, habichuelas secas y l&iacute;quidos tales como: jugo de naranja, n&eacute;ctares de albaricoque, mang&oacute; y pera, jugo "V-8" y "Gatorade."
</ul>

<p><a name="Batida de Frutas"><b>Batida</a> de
Frutas</b><br>
Cuando usted es VIH positivo se sentir&aacute; algunos d&iacute;as sin
deseos de comer.  Usted podr&iacute;a desarrollar &uacute;lceras en la
boca o en la garganta que le hacen dif&iacute;cil el masticar y el tragar.
Es posible que padezca de diarrea cuando tome leche o coma productos
l&aacute;cteos.  <a href="s-recipe.html">Las siguientes recetas</a> le ayudar&aacute;n a preparar bebidas altas en proteinas y calor&iacute;as que a su vez sean bajas en
lactosa o libres de l&aacute;cteos.  De esta manera usted podr&aacute;
mantener su peso mientras maneja problemas espec&iacute;ficos.  Para
preparar cada receta mezcle los ingredientes en una licuadora o procesador
de alimentos a una velocidad alta por uno o dos minutos.  Trate de
variarlas a&ntilde;adi&eacute;ndoles diferentes tipos de frutas para que
no se canse de ninguna de ellas.</p>

<p><a name="La Diabetes"><b>La Diabetes y el VIH</b></a><br>
La diabetes es una condici&oacute;n medica que puede existir antes de que usted sea VIH positivo, o la condic&oacute;n puede desarollarse de los efectos de enfermedades espec&iacute;ficas (por ejemplo, fracaso de los ri&ntilde;ones) o ciertos medicamentos (por ejemplo, "pentamidine.")  Con frecuencia, pero no siempre, el diabetes ocurre en la gente que pesan demasiado.  </p>

<p>Si usted est&aacute; diabetico y VIH positivo los fines mayores son: </p>

<ul>
<li>controlar los niveles del az&uacute;car en su sangre (menos de 200 mg/dl est&aacute; bien) 
<li>consumir suficiente calor&iacute;as para prevenir el perder peso 
<li>consumir suficiente prote&iacute;nas para construir nuevos tejidos musculares que usted puede perder como resultado de las infecciones 
<li>tomar una pastilla multivitamina y mineral a diario para aumentar las cantidades de vitaminas y minerales en su cuerpo.
</ul>

<p>Normalmente, los alimentos que usted come son descompuestos y convertidos en energ&iacute;a.  Su cuerpo descompone <b>almidones</b>, que tambi&eacute;n se llaman <b>carbohidratos</b>, en un az&uacute;car que se llama glucosa y usa esa para energ&iacute;a, en la misma manera en que un coche usa la gasolina.  Para ser usada, la glucosa primero tiene que entrar en las c&eacute;lulas de su cuerpo.  Para hacer eso, se necesita una <b>hormona </b>que se llama "insulina" que actua como una llave que abre la puerta a sus c&eacute;lulas para que la glucosa pueda entrar.  Despu&eacute;s de comer una comida, el nivel de glucosa en su sangre sube y su cuerpo responde al crecimiento de energ&iacute;a disponible por el emitir de insulina.  La insulina trae la glucosa a las c&eacute;lulas del cuerpo, donde la glucosa est&aacute; convertida en energ&iacute;a.  En diabetes, o no hay suficiente insulina o no hay insulina para hacer eso.  Como resultado de esta falta, el nivel de glucosa en su sangre sube m&aacute;s y m&aacute;s alto y por fin se desborda en su orina.  A lo mejor usted se siente d&eacute;bil y deshidrato porque su cuerpo pierde l&iacute;quidos mientras que trata de eliminar la glucosa extra.  Es importante tomar muchos l&iacute;quidos para prevenir el deshidraci&oacute;n.  Los requ&iacute;sitos dietarios especiales para diabetes est&aacute;n relacionado al tipo de tratamiento que su m&eacute;dico le prescribe. <b> Su diabetes puede ser controlado solamente por su dieto</b>, o <b>por una pastilla</b> (conocido como un agente oral "hypoglycemic" como "Micronase" o "Diabenese"), o <b>injecciones de insulin a diario</b>.</p>

<p>Las siguientes gu&iacute;as para comer est&aacute;n recomendidas si usted es diab&eacute;tico y VIH positivo:</p>

<p><b>Evite el comer az&uacute;cares simples y dulces concentrados</b>, por ejemplo: </p>

<ul>
<li>sucrosa, dextrosa, glucosa, fructosa y maltosa 
<li>miel, "molasses", sirope de ma&iacute;z, sirope "maple", sirope de chocolate 
<li>las frutas empacadas en sirope pesado o ligero 
<li>dulces, chocolate y "granola bars" 
<li>"jelly, jam, preserves," mermelada, "sweet pickles y relish" pasteles, empa&ntilde;adas, galletas, "pastries y donuts" 
<li>mantecados, helados, "popsicles", helado de fruta y postres congelados 
<li>flanes, yogur con sabor a frutas, leche condensada y "jello" regular 
<li>cereal con az&uacute;car y "granola"
<li>chicle con az&uacute;car, "breath mints" y "cough drops"
<li>"Kool-Aid", refrescos, bebidos de frutas, ponche y 
n&eacute;ctares de frutas
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Evite el tomar vino, cerveza y bebidos alcoh&oacute;licos porque estos bajan los niveles del az&uacute;car en su sangre. 
<li>Consuma cantidades moderados de almidones durante el d&iacute;a como: panes, frutas, vegetales con almidones y productos l&aacute;cteos para mantener los niveles del az&uacute;car en su sangre dentro de l&iacute;mitos aceptables.  Almidones complejos que son altos en fibra (panes de grano enteros y cereales) son los mejores tipos de energ&iacute;a para sus m&uacute;sculos y controlar&aacute;n el nivel del az&uacute;car en su sangre mejor que los az&uacute;cares simples.
<li>Es mejor comer una fruta que tomar jugo porque la fruta contiene fibra, pero no se olvide comer las frutas en moderaci&oacute;n porque demasiado levantar&aacute; los niveles del az&uacute;car en su sangre.  Si usted tiene poco apetito y necesita tomar un suplemento nutricional, toma Glucerna porque contiene fibra de dieta.  Este suplemento est&aacute; fabricado por los diab&eacute;ticos.  Preg&uacute;ntele a su m&eacute;dico con respecto a obteniendo una prescripci&oacute;n que puede ser cubierto por Medicaid.
<li>Para que consuma suficiente calor&iacute;as para mantener su peso, una cantidad m&aacute;s grande de su calor&iacute;as necesitar&aacute; ser de las grasas incluyendo: mantequilla/margarina, aceite para cocinar, crema agria, queso crema, mantequilla de nueces sin az&uacute;car y mayonesa sin az&uacute;car.
<li>A&ntilde;ada dulcificantes sin az&uacute;car a los alimentos y bebidos porque no afectan los niveles del az&uacute;car en su sangre.  Use "Equal" (NutraSweet) y "Sweet 'N Low" (sacarina).  Toma por lo menos ocho tazas de l&iacute;quido con estos dulcificantes a diario.
<li>El comer a la misma hora y el hacer ejercicios aer&oacute;bicos regulares son importantes en ayudandole controlar los niveles del az&uacute;car en su sangre.  Hable con su m&eacute;dico antes de que usted empiece un programa de ejercicio regular.
<li>Si los niveles del az&uacute;car en su sangre son constantemente afuera de 200 mg/dl cuando usted los revise, preg&uacute;ntele a su m&eacute;dico acerca de modificando la dosis de su pastilla o insulin.  A lo mejor usted tambi&eacute;n necesitar&aacute; un plan de comidas individual con cantidades iguales de carbohidratos distribuidas durante el d&iacute;a.  Preg&uacute;ntele a su nutricionista ayudarle dise&ntilde;ar un plan de comidas basado en los alimentos que le gustan comer.
<li>Usted puede tener varias problemas de nutrici&oacute;n pasandon al mismo tiempo con VIH infecci&oacute;n.  A lo mejor necesitar&aacute; cambiar los gu&iacute;as presentados aqu&iacute; seg&uacute;n sus requisitos personales.  Por ejemplo, si usted tiene diarrea, usted necesitar&aacute; comer alimentos bajos en grasas y fibras y evitar productos l&aacute;cteos.  Si usted tiene poco apetito, a lo mejor podr&aacute; comer m&aacute;s az&uacute;cares simples con insulin extra.  Preg&uacute;ntele a su nutricionista si usted necesita ayuda en alterar su plan de comer.

<blockquote>

<p><b>VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES</b></p>

<ol>
<li><b>KITCHEN</b> volunteers assist our chefs in preparation of over 2,000 hot, nutritious meals every weekday. Volunteers are expected to work one, three-hour shift per week in our kitchen; these shifts start as early as 6 a.m and continue until 9 p.m.  Duties involve food preparation (e.g., slicing, dicing and cleaning food), washing pots and pans, general cleaning, and food packaging.  Working well as part of a group is essential. Volunteers who wish to work in the kitchen must attend a 2&#189; hour training session on food safety and knife skills.
<p>
<li><b>MEAL DELIVERY</b> volunteers bring meals to our clients from Neighborhood Meal Distribution Centers located throughout New York's 5 boroughs, and in Hudson County, New Jersey. Volunteers are assigned to routes near their home or workplace, these routes contain 1 or more clients who live in close proximity to a distribution center. Volunteers are asked to deliver a minimum of once a week. Meals are delivered between 10am and 3pm with the average delivery time taking about an hour.
<p>
<li><b>VAN ASSISTANT</b> volunteers help the drivers in delivering the meals to our distribution centers as well as to individual clients.  The van assistant reports to our delivery department at 8:30am and are out on the road for approximately 6 hours, requiring a commitment of one day per week.
<p>
<li><b>OFFICE</b> volunteers answer phones, process mail, copy, file and assist in all general office work.  There are five departments where one may work: Administration, Finance, Delivery, Client and Volunteer Services.  Volunteers are expected to work one three-hour shift per week.
<p>
<li><b>DEVELOPMENT</b> volunteers assist the Development staff in fundraising. Duties include: phone calls, word processing and general office work. Anyone with specialized fundraising skills is also welcome to plan and/or participate in projects and events. Volunteers are regularly scheduled for one three-hour shift per week.

<li><b>DATA ENTRY</b> volunteers help process donations, both in the computer and on paper - they are integral to the tracking and handling of all donations.  Three hour shifts are during business hours once a week or Wednesday evening from 6 to 9pm.

<li><b>SPECIAL EVENTS</b> volunteers assist us with non-regularly scheduled events such as: outreaches in the community, street and health fairs, benefits, etc.  These events serve to raise funds, introduce our program to the public and recruit volunteers. The time commitment varies from event to event, many occuring in the evening or on the weekend. Also, there are projects such as mailings, assembling Thanksgiving baskets, wrapping Christmas cards, etc.
</ol>

<p>All prospective volunteers go through a brief orientation process with a staff member or a trained volunteer. During this process, a form is completed with all vital information (names, addresses), references, one's availability, and any special skills or interests one may have. An agreement is also signed denoting the voluntary (i.e., unpaid) nature of the work, the confidentiality of our work and clients, and your commitment to service. All volunteers are asked to sign a liability waiver. Once accepted, a volunteer is trained on site by a staff member or experienced volunteer.</p>

<p><img src="../gifs/phone.gif" alt="[phone]" hspace=5 vspace=2 align=left>Individuals interested in volunteering should contact the Volunteer Department at (212) 294-8104 for further information or to set up an orientation.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in <b>GOD'S <font color="#ff0000">LOVE</font> WE DELIVER</b> and we look forward to welcoming you as a part of our volunteer team.</p>

<p align=center>Needs your help serving meals to your neighbors

<p align=center>We are looking for caring individuals who have time once or twice a week <br>to deliver pre-packed meals on the lunch hour. </p>

<p align=center>We are the only meal program that delivers to all five boroughs of New York City and to Hudson County, NJ. <br>
We feed nearly 1,000 clients and their family dependents.

<p align=center><b>What is involved?</b> Attending an hour orientation/training <br>regarding delivery procedures.<br>
Volunteers check in with the dispatcher in the morning, pack meals in the brown bags provided and walk or drive them to the homes of the clients.</p>

<p align=center><b>When do I need to be available?</b> Between the hours of 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. <br>The actual delivery time is one hour.</p>

<p><img src="../gifs/phone.gif" alt="[phone]" hspace=5 vspace=2 align=left>If you are an organization that has a core of volunteers, we would be interested in hearing from you as a potential drop-off site. Local neighborhood groups are most effective in feeding their own neighbors and children. GLWD presently uses churches, synagogues, businesses, rehabilitation centers and service organizations as its distribution centers. For more information on whether your group can become a neighborhood meal distribution center, please call Larry Seville at (212) 294-8152.</p>

<p><b>NUTRITION EDUCATION PUBLICATIONS LIST</b></p>


<ul>
<li><b><a href="../tips6-94.html">Eating Tips for HIV Disease</a></b></p>

<dt>This 15-page resource guide targets non-medical professionals and is suitable for readers with higher literacy skills.  The booklet offers recommendations for healthy food choices, eating tips for maximizing protein and energy intake to gain quality weight, guidelines for taking vitamin and mineral supplements, advice on managing nutrition problems that may interfere with the ability to eat, and basic food safety tips.  The guide is available in Spanish (<a href="../spanish/tips-sp.html"><b>Consejos de Alimentaci&oacute;n para el VIH</b></a>) with culturally relevant modifications.
<p>
<li><b>Living with HIV:  A Nutrition Guide with Special Emphasis for People in Recovery</b>

<dt>This 21-page booklet contains brightly colored graphics and easy-to-understand concepts, that discuss the interrelationships among nutrition care, medical treatment, and recovery from addiction.  Information is communicated in a language familiar to the audience and addresses the practical realities of life experienced by people living with HIV/AIDS.  The booklet includes nutrition survival skills, such as eating modifications to alleviate specific dietary problems, ways to obtain assistance in the management of nutrition and medical problems, recommendations on nutritious fast food choices, food safety tips, information on the benefits of exercise to build and maintain muscle mass; and the importance of continued recovery for substance users.  A Spanish version of the booklet, entitled Viviendo con el VIH:  Una Gu&iacute;a de Nutrici&oacute;n con &Eacute;nfasis Especial para las Personas en Recuperaci&oacute;n, also is available.
<p>
<li><b>Food Guides for Eating Right to Fight HIV</b>

<dt>These six culturally appropriate ethnic food guides serve as teaching tools for people living with HIV/AIDS.  Their categorization of foods by nutrient function rather than by food groups has proven an effective strategy in communicating the benefits and content of a high complex carbohydrate, high protein, and moderate fat diet with adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals.  Foods are divided into <b>Energy</b> — with emphasis on complex carbohydrates, <b>Growth</b> — including both animal and vegetable sources of protein to maintain and rebuild muscles, and <b>Protection</b> — including food sources high in antioxidants and other vitamins and minerals.  The following versions are available:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../guides/gen.html"><b>General food guide in English</b></a>;
<li><a href="../guides/afam.html"><b>African-American guide in English</b></a>;
<li><a href="../guides/span.html"><b>Spanish guide for Latinos/as</b></a>;
<li><a href="../guides/api.html"><b>Asian/Pacific Islander guide in English</b></a>;
<li><a href="../guides/west.html"><b>West Indian guide for English-speaking West Indians</b></a>;
<li><a href="../guides/fre.html"><b>French guide for French-speaking West Indians and Africans</b></a>.
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Technical Assistance Manual for Community-Based Food and Nutrition Programs Serving People Living with HIV/AIDS</b>

<dt>This manual is a comprehensive guide that addresses how to create, sustain, and expand programs that provide PLWAs with practical, community-based nutrition services in the form of home-delivered meals, congregate meals, food pantry programs, and nutrition education and counseling.  It is based on responses to a nationwide Needs Assessment Survey that was mailed to more than 90 AIDS service organizations which already offer nutrition-related services to their clients or plan to do so in the future.  The purposes of the manual are:  1) to share vital information that will guide start-up agencies, along with helping established community-based nutrition programs to enhance existing programs and to expand into new areas of service; 2) to establish standards of care which are feasible, realistic, and adaptable to the needs of diverse communities; and 3) to create a common understanding of the importance and cost-effectiveness of community-based nutrition support among service providers, funders, government agencies, and public policy makers.  The final product is the result of our merging the lessons we have learned in our first decade of service, the unique insight and experience shared with us in the survey, and the latest information about nutrition and its impact on HIV disease.

<H3 align=center>THE MOMENTUM AIDS PROJECT FACT SHEET</H3>

<p>The mission of The Momentum AIDS Project is to foster hope and promote
long-term survival by providing communal meals and supportive counseling services
in a caring, non-judgmental environment to New Yorkers living with HIV/AIDS and
their families.</p>

<TABLE CELLSPACING=10>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><B>BACKGROUND</B></TD>
<TD>Founded in
1985, Momentum is one of New York City's oldest AIDS service organizations and
the only community-based organization providing communal meals and supportive
services in a neighborhood setting to New Yorkers with HIV/AIDS and their families.  Headed by Executive
Director Dawn Bryan, we operate nine weekly programs at churches and synagogues
in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx.  All of our sites are located in
neighborhoods that are considered  at high risk for HIV/AIDS and are
traditionally under-served.  In fact, the New York State Department of Health has
designated the areas we serve as in "greatest need" for emergency meals.</TD>

</TR><p><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><B>CLIENTS</B></TD>
<TD
VALIGN=TOP>Momentum serves 1,500 clients, all of whom are diagnosed with HIV or
AIDS and most of whom are low-income.  The AIDS epidemic is now inextricably
linked to the broader social problems of poverty and homelessness and is having a
devastating impact on poor communities, especially communities of color.  Over
80% of Momentum's clients are African American or Latino, and fully 70% lack
permanent housing -- many living in single-room occupancy hotels.</TD>
</TR><p><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="volun.html"><B>VOLUNTEERS</B></A></TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Volunteers are a mainstay of Momentum's program.  We rely on a
dedicated corps of nearly 300 individuals, who help with everything from
preparing and serving food, baking, and packing grocery bags to assisting with
client registration, office support, and special events.</TD>
</TR><p><TR> <TD
VALIGN=TOP><A HREF="nutrition.html"><B>NUTRITION</B></A></TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>Malnutrition is the leading cause of death among people with AIDS.  And, with
many people now living for long periods after becoming infected with HIV, good
nutrition is increasingly important.  Momentum was the first and remains one of
the only AIDS organizations in New York serving people who are newly diagnosed
HIV positive (most will not provide services until someone has a diagnosis of
AIDS).  Ironically, of course, supportive care, especially food and nutrition
services, can play a critical role in postponing the onset of symptomatic AIDS.

<P>
Food and nutrition are the centerpiece of Momentum's program.  And, because many people with HIV/AIDS have low energy levels and trouble attending multiple appointments, we seek to provide a full range of critical services at each of our sites -- in effect a one-stop shopping program.  Thus, in addition to sustaining the health and well-being of our clients, our meal programs provide a critical point of entry for New Yorkers living with HIV/AIDS to access support groups and individual counseling on a wide range of issues.

<H2>HELP US HELP OTHERS</H2>

There are many ways you can help Momentum sustain life and hope for New Yorkers living
with HIV/AIDS.
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/line_red2.gif" WIDTH=600><P>
<H3>MAKE A FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION</H3>
Government budget cuts continue to reduce the availability of AIDS services.  And,
because Momentum is a visible presence in eight high-risk neighborhoods, more and
more New Yorkers with HIV/AIDS are turning to us for services they are losing elsewhere. 
To meet this demand and help provide a continuum of care for our clients, Momentum
relies on the financial support of concerned individuals.
<P>
If you can, please write a check payable to The Momentum Project and mail it to us at
155 West 23rd Street, New York, NY 10011.  You can also ask your employer if they will
match your contribution.  
<P>
You can designate Momentum to receive your United Way contributions using the "Donor
Choice" option.
<P>
You can also make The Momentum AIDS Project a charitable beneficiary of your will. 
The following language is recommended:<BR>
<UL>
     "I give, devise, and bequeath to The Momentum AIDS Project (Momentum
     Project, Inc.), 155 West 23rd Street, New York, NY 10011, (% of my estate),
     ($______), (all the residue of my estate, including real and personal
     property)."</UL>
<P>
If you have questions, please <a href="mailto:momentum@aidsnyc.org">e-mail us</A> or call (212) 691-8100, Ext. 322.
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/line_red2.gif" WIDTH=600><P>
<A HREF="aidswalk.html"><H3>JOIN MOMENTUM'S AIDS WALK 1997 TEAM</A></H3>


<P><IMG SRC="gifs/line_red2.gif" WIDTH=600><P>
<H3><B>DONATE FOOD</B></H3><BR>
In addition to providing hot, family-style meals, Momentum supplies clients with grocery bags
containing enough food for ten home-cooked meals.  Due to recent cutbacks in government
funding and food programs, we need donations of canned and dry goods that are nutritious and
easy to prepare with limited kitchen facilities.  Some of the items we need include:
<P>
<B>Beverages:</B>  Easy-to-open, individual servings of juice (cans or cartons) or non-
               perishable milk-based drinks.  Boxes of Carnation Instant Breakfast are
               especially helpful.</DIV>
<P>
<B>Soups:</B>  Chunky vegetable or vegetable and meat soups.  Bean, lentil, and pasta
               mixtures.
<P>
<B>Cereals & Grains:</B>    Individual serving sizes of dry or instant cereals.  Rice and pasta.
               Dried peas, beans, and lentils.
<P>
<B>Vegetables:</B>
All types of canned vegetables, beans, and lentils.
<P>
<B>Entrees:</B>  Canned tuna, chicken, hash, chili, and pasta with meat mixtures.
<P>
<B>Fruits & Desserts:</B>  Canned fruits, applesauce, non-perishable puddings, cakes, and cookies.
<P>
<B>Toiletries:</B>  Soap, shampoo, Kleenex, toilet paper, toothbrushes, and toothpaste
<P>
For more information, call Gail Topp at (212) 691-8100, Ext. 313.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/line_red2.gif" WIDTH=600><P>
<H3>DONATE CLOTHING</H3>
Many people with HIV/AIDS experience dramatic weight fluctuations that result in the need for
new clothing.  Unfortunately, most of our clients are low-income, and Momentum welcomes
donations of men's clothing.  Some of the items that are most needed include:
<P>
Coats, jackets, and sweaters<BR>
Jeans, khakis, and overalls<BR>
Sweatpants and sweatshirts<BR>
Loose shirts and tee shirts<BR>
Clean underwear and socks<BR>
Shoes<BR>
<P>
Secondhand or new clothing that is clean and in good condition can be dropped off at 155 West 23rd
Street on the 11th Floor.  We can also arrange pick-ups if needed.  For more information, call
David Guzman at (212) 691-8100, Ext. 352.
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/line_red2.gif" WIDTH=600><P>
<H3>DONATE A WISH LIST ITEM</H3>
Momentum would welcome donations of any of the following equipment and supplies:
<UL>
Physician's scales, preferably with height measurement apparatus<BR>
Bio-Electrical Impedance Analyzer<BR>
Nutritional and vitamin mineral supplements<BR>

<blockquote>
<p><b>The National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project is dedicated to facilitating the effort for development of effective treatment for HIV. We advocate on treatment and policy issues for people with HIV and AIDS with drug companies, government officials (including FDA) and other treatment and policy advocates. NATAP is committed to the concept of, at least, making HIV manageable. We will not rest until this is a reality. We are equally committed to disseminating important treatment information to concerned people. NATAP's ongoing community lecture series on "emerging issues for HIV/AIDS therapies" hosted "Protease Inhibitors: Current and Future Use", in New York City on January 6, 1996, and "Protease Inhibitors and Viral Load: Current and Future Use"  in Los Angeles on April 13, 1996. Our committment to treatment education is reflected by the success of these free community treatment forums.</b></p>

<p>STATE OF NEW YORK<br>
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH<br>
Corning Tower	The Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza<br>
Albany, New York  12237<br>
Barbara A. DeBuono, M.D., M.P.H<br>
Commissioner<br>
<br>
Karen Schimke<br>
Executive Deputy Commissioner<br>
August 1995</p>

<p>Dear Health Care Professional:<br>
As part of our continuing commitment to clinical education, the AIDS Institute is pleased to provide you with a third edition of Protocols for the Primary Care of HIV/AIDS in Adults and Adolescents.</p>

<p>Regular review and revision of these clinical practice guidelines help to ensure that HIV/AIDS care in New York State reflects the most current medical knowledge. Clinicians have an active role in shaping the guidelines, which serve as an educational resource for practitioners throughout the state. The protocols, together with the Clinical Education Initiative and the HIV Quality of Care Program, are the three major components of the AIDS Institute's strategy for continual improvement of HIV health services.</p>

<p>This third edition packet contains updated versions of the following protocols: HIV Medical Evaluation and Preventive Care, Antiretroviral Therapy Management, Experimental Treatments, Nutrition in HIV Infection, Tuberculosis Management for People with HIV Infection, and Health Care Services for Women with HIV Infection. The protocol Prophylaxis of Opportunistic Infections has been expanded to include new information on prophylaxis for a number of diseases in addition to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. New protocols address oral health and the management of substance users in the HIV primary care setting.</p>

<p>Separate protocol packets have been developed for children and adults. However, many of the protocols, including those for the care of adolescents, may be found in both packets.</p>

<p>Each protocol has been developed by a group of clinicians with significant experience providing care to people with HIV infection. The groups include infectious diseases specialists, internists, family practitioners, obstetrician/gynecologists, pediatricians, and specialists in adolescent medicine, as well as a clinical pharmacologist, experimental treatments expert, registered dietitian, and people with HIV. The guidelines reflect the consensus of the groups to the greatest extent possible. Wherever consensus was not possible, options for clinical management have been indicated.</p>

<p>Since primary care practitioners are assumed to be the principal users of the protocols, we have sought to make the guidelines practical for use in any primary care setting. We welcome your comments and specific suggestions and look forward to receiving your completed evaluation, for which a questionnaire is enclosed. The evaluation guides our efforts to make the protocols as useful as possible and is an essential part of the revision process.</p>

<p>We encourage you to photocopy or otherwise reproduce these materials for distribution. Additional copies of these protocols and other AIDS Institute clinical guidelines can be obtained by completing and returning the enclosed AIDS Institute Publications Order Form.</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued commitment to providing high-quality clinical HIV care in this challenging and relentless epidemic. Your efforts help to improve the standard of care and availability of resources for all people with HIV.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Bruce D. Agins, MD, MPH<br>
MEDICAL DIRECTOR</p>

<font size=3>August 1995</font></h2>

<blockquote>
<font size=-1>

<p>All people with HIV infection benefit from routine medical monitoring regardless of the clinical stage of illness. The comprehensive evaluation of people with HIV infection includes medical and psychosocial history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The following recommendations emphasize conditions that can be associated with HIV disease.</p>

<p><b>GOALS</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Stage HIV disease for prognostic and treatment purposes.
<li>Identify active HIV-related opportunistic infections and tumors.
<li>Identify medical conditions associated with specific risk behaviors, such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and infections and chronic diseases associated with drug use.
<li>Identify psychosocial problems that need to be addressed, such as family or friends affected by HIV or psychological stress related to HIV status.
<li>Develop strategies to:
<ul>
<li>Prevent transmission of HIV.
<li>Delay progression of HIV and its associated immune system dysfunction.
<li>Prevent onset of HIV-related infections.
</ul>
<li>Identify non HIV-related health care needs. 
<li>Assist the patient in making informed health choices.
</ul>

<p><b>EVALUATION</b><br>
Complete Medical History<br>

</ul>

<p><b>COMPREHENSIVE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</b><br>
Pay special attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>GENERAL: weight change, evidence of muscle wasting, adenopathy
<li>SKIN: psoriasis, eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, molluscum contagiosum, dermatophytes, Kaposi's sarcoma
<li>EYE: dilated funduscopic examination to look for exudates associated with cytomegalovirus retinitis, toxoplasmosis
<li>ORAL: soft tissue exam, including evidence of candidiasis, herpes simplex, leukoplakia, aphthous ulcers, Kaposi's sarcoma, gingivitis
<li>NEUROLOGIC: complete neurologic examination including 
mental status, sensory or motor deficits, abnormal sensation
<li>RECTAL: anal/perirectal chancroid, syphilis, herpes simplex, molluscum contagiosum, condidiasis, condylomata, or other lesions
<li>PELVIC/GENITOURINARY: include speculum, bimanual and rectal exam; evidence of genital or anal/perirectal chancroid, syphilis, herpes simplex, molluscum contagiosum, candidiasis, condylomata or other lesions, adnexal masses, or evidence of PID
</ul>

<p><b>REFERRALS</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Prompt referrals should be made to dentists and ophthalmologists when abnormal conditions are detected. Referrals to gynecologists, neurologists, and dermatologists should be readily available as needed to supplement the treatment offered by the primary care practitioner.
<li>Persons with &lt; 50 CD4 cells/mm3 should be referred for a dilated funduscopic examination by an ophthalmologist.
</ul>

<p><b>LABORATORY TESTS AND FOLLOW-UP</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Complete blood cell count with differential
<dt>Evaluate for anemia, thrombocytopenia, or granulocytopenia associated with HIV.
<dt>– NORMAL: Follow yearly or as needed.
<dt>– ABNORMAL: If Hct &gt;30 and/or platelets &gt;100K and stable, follow every 3 months.
<dt>– ABNORMAL: If Hct &lt;30 and/or platelets &lt;100K, follow as clinically indicated.
<dt>– If patient is on antiretroviral therapy, see Antiretroviral protocol.
<li>Multichannel chemistry panel
<dt>Perform renal and liver function tests.
<dt>If patient is on antiretroviral therapy, see Antiretroviral protocol.
<li>Hepatitis B (HBV) panel
<dt>Positive HBV antigen or antibody is evidence of present or prior HBV infection. HBV antigen positivity indicates communicability of infection. If only HBV antibody is positive, past infection has occurred.
<dt>If HBV antigen and core antibody are negative, recommend HBV vaccination if the individual is at continued risk for acquiring HBV.
<li>Tuberculin skin test with anergy panel
<dt>A positive PPD test is defined as >5mm of induration.
<ul>
<li>PPD NEGATIVE, NOT ANERGIC:
<dt>– Repeat annually.
<dt>– Individuals in high-risk areas for exposure to TB should be PPD tested every 6 months.
<li>PPD NEGATIVE, ANERGIC:
<dt>– Obtain chest X-ray.
<dt>– Evaluate for extrapulmonary disease.
<dt>– If chest X-ray is normal, review indications for prophylaxis of anergic patients.
<li> PPD POSITIVE:
<dt>– Evaluate for active tuberculosis.
<dt>– If active TB is present or exposure to multidrug-resistant TB is suspected, consult with an infectious diseases or pulmonary specialist.
<dt>– If no evidence of active TB, prophylax with INH if no previous prophylaxis.
</ul>
<dt>(Also see Tuberculosis Management for People with HIV Infection protocol)
<li>Toxoplasmosis serology
<dt>Screen for baseline exposure status. If negative, repeat annually. If positive, consider prophylaxis for CD4 <100/mm3.
<li>Syphilis serology
<dt>Screen for syphilis with VDRL or RPR. A positive result on either of these tests should be confirmed with the FTA-ABS test.
<dt>– NEGATIVE VDRL/RPR; NEGATIVE FTA: Repeat annually.
<dt>– NEGATIVE VDRL/RPR; POSITIVE FTA: Indicates past, successfully treated or inactive infection. Very rarely, active syphilis may be accompanied by a false-negative VDRL/RPR. This test invariably becomes positive when it is repeated a week or two later.
<dt>– POSITIVE VDRL/RPR; POSITIVE FTA: Take syphilis treatment history. If the patient is untreated or treatment history is not known, treat at minimum with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units IM per week x 3 weeks. Consider further evaluation for neurosyphilis. 
<ul>
<li>A lumbar puncture should be considered when:
<dt>– Titer of VDRL/RPR remains elevated for a year or more following treatment, or has been elevated for an unknown duration of time.
<dt>– Previous treatment history is unknown.
<dt>A lumbar puncture should be performed if neurologic symptoms are present. If a lumbar puncture cannot be performed, consider empiric treatment for presumed neurosyphilis.
</ul>
<dt>– POSITIVE VDRL/RPR; NEGATIVE FTA: False-positive VDRL/RPR reactions are common in HIVinfection, sometimes at unusually high titers. They are caused by cross-reacting antibodies in the test, and should not lead to treatment for syphilis.
<li>Gonorrhea culture
<dt>Screen all women, even if asymptomatic. Culture all men with urethritis. Obtain pharyngeal and anal cultures as indicated, based upon history and physical exam. Treat all patients with positive cultures. Partners should be evaluated and treated.
<li>Chlamydia culture
<dt>Screen all women, even if asymptomatic. Perform diagnostic test for all men with urethritis. Treat all patients with positive test results. Partners should be evaluated and treated.
<li>Pap smear
<dt>Screen all women at least every 12 months. Women with HIV infection have more aggressive cervical dysplasia and cancer than uninfected women.
<li>Urinalysis
<dt>Dipstick for proteinuria.
<li>Pregnancy test
<dt>Test if the patient's menstrual history and physical examination suggest it is indicated. If positive, counseling about pregnancy decisions should be nondirective and should include current information on the risks of perinatal transmission of HIV and the treatment of HIV infection. Provide sufficient information for the woman to make informed decisions regarding her options. Pregnant women with HIV infection should have information about, and access to, all interventions that may reduce the rate of mother-to-infant HIV transmission. Prompt referrals for prenatal care or termination of pregnancy should be made.
<dt>(See Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Zidovudine Therapy in Pregnancy to Reduce Perinatal Transmission of HIV, in protocol folder.)
<li>Chest X-ray
<dt>Screen for asymptomatic pulmonary disease. If abnormal, evaluate as clinically indicated. Otherwise, use as baseline for comparison if respiratory symptoms develop.
<li>CD4 lymphocyte count
<dt>Monitor CD4 lymphocyte count at 6-month intervals for those with CD4 &gt;500/mm3. Obtain counts at 3-month intervals for those with CD4 &lt;500/mm3. Monitoring should be more frequent when counts approach a level where an intervention is recommended or to assess effect of treatment (see table on p. 6).
</ul>

<p><b>PREVENTIVE HEALTH<br>
VACCINATIONS</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pneumococcal vaccination should be given once.
<li>Influenza vaccination should be given yearly.
<li>HBV vaccination should be considered if person is antigen/core
antibody negative.
<li>H. influenzae vaccination may be considered.
<li>Diphtheria/Tetanus immunizations should be performed every
ten years.
<dt><b>PROPHYLAXIS</b>
<li>Tuberculosis prophylaxis should be based upon PPD and anergy screening results. See Tuberculosis Management for People with HIV Infection protocol.
<li>Recommendations regarding Pneumocystis, toxoplasmosis, M. avium and other opportunistic infection prophylaxis appear in Prophylaxis for Opportunistic Infections protocol.
<dt><b>ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUG THERAPY</b>
<dt>Use the following chart as a guide to monitoring CD4 cell counts and initiating discussion of antiretroviral therapy.
</ul>

</table></center>

<p>(Also see Antiretroviral Therapy Management and Prophylaxis of Opportunistic Infections protocols)</p>

<p><b>HIV PREVENTION EDUCATION AND COUNSELING</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Explain methods for preventing HIV transmission, including:
<ul>
<li>Safer sex;
<li>Barrier contraception;
<li>Avoiding breast-feeding;
<li>Avoiding risks of fetal transmission; and
<li>Safer use of needles and syringes if patient is an intravenous substance user.
</ul>
<li>Counsel health maintenance, including:
<ul>
<li>Nutrition;
<li>Exercise; and
<li>Harm reduction through avoidance of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.
</ul>
<li>Review signs and symptoms requiring medical attention.
</ul>

<p><b>PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL-SUPPORT COUNSELING</b></p>

<p>Take past and current psychiatric history, including diagnoses, hospitalizations and medications.</p>

<ul>
<li>Assess for: 
<ul>
<li>Dementia and other neuropsychiatric HIV-related disorders
<li>Depression and suicide risk
</ul>
<li>Assess functional ability (activities of daily living)
<ul>
<li>Home care needs
</ul>
<li>Asess entitlements
<ul>
<li>medical coverage
<li>housing needs
<li>transportation
<li>employment status
</ul>
<li>Assess support network
<ul>
<li>family
<li>friends
<li>support groups/therapy
</ul>
<li>Be aware of psychological issues that may occur throughout all stages of HIV illness:
<ul>
<li>denial, grief, anger, self-blame, shame, depression 
</ul>
<li>Be aware of behavior patterns that may indicate coping difficulties:
<ul>
<li>isolation, secrecy, recurrent substance use
</ul>
<li>Be aware of issues for which patients may need psychological, legal, or professional support:
<ul>
<li>disclosure of HIV diagnosis to significant other/family members
<li>advance directives
<li>permanency planning
<li>immigration issues
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>FOLLOW-UP CARE AND MONITORING</b><p>

<p>Emphasize the importance of follow-up to all patients. Although not all patients will need or accept antiretroviral or other therapy, each person with HIV infection needs periodic monitoring of clinical and laboratory parameters as well as an overall care plan. Risk reduction education is important for individuals in all stages of HIV infection.</p>

<ul>
<dt><b>ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS</b>
<li>Careful history and physical examination, as previously described, to be repeated at 6-month intervals while asymptomatic.
<li>Incorporate patient education and psychosocial support into each visit.
<li>Prophylactic measures (if not previously addressed). Discuss antiretro-viral therapies.
<li>Perform CBC, multichannel chemistry panel, VDRL, and urinalysis at least annually.
<dt><b>SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS</b>
<li>Care at this stage requires management of clinically evident illness supplemented by routine attention to early recognition of opportunistic syndromes and diseases. The goals are:
<ul>
<li>Early recognition of infection;
<li>Recognition of indications for antiretroviral therapy;
<li>Management of clinically evident disease; and
<li>Preparation for increasing severity of illness.
</ul>
<li>Follow-up clinic appointments should be scheduled at 1-to-3-month intervals at a minimum, depending on severity of illness.
<li>Take a careful history and perform a thorough physical examination of the patient.
<li>Perform CBC and multichannel chemistry panel at least every six months; perform urinalysis and VDRL at least annually.
<li>Discuss antiretroviral therapy (including combination therapy) and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections.
<li>Discuss psychosocial issues, which are similar to those for asymptomatic individuals. Patients also should be evaluated for such benefits as Medicaid, disability, and home services. If needed, refer to a case manager or a social worker. In addition, all patients should be counseled about a living will to address such issues as DNR, respirator support, power of attorney, health care proxy, permanency planning, and will for disposal of assets.
</ul>

<p><b>THE DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP</b><p>

<p>The evolving nature of HIV/AIDS care has altered the doctor-patient relationship. New treatment approaches and varying opinions about currently available treatments and their efficacy require an open discussion of these options. Patients should be encouraged to actively participate in decision-making about their care.</p>

<p><b>EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS</b></p>

<p>Inform the patient of the ever-changing array of treatments for HIV and AIDS-related disorders. Discuss the option of clinical trials, including why they are done and their risks and benefits. While the physician can offer advice, the final decision to undertake any treatment, experimental or recommended, rests with the patient. Refer the patient to sources of information included in the Experimental Treatments protocol.</p>

<p><b>ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS</b></p>

<p>Patients may supplement recommended medical treatments with other medical or non-medical treatments. The physician should discuss the pros and cons of these treatments with their patients, and assist patients in the evaluation of their merit. Open discussion of such alternative or complementary therapies, and consideration of their role in health management, will promote communication and result in greater willingness by patients to ask their physicians' advice before trying “alternative” treatments or joining a clinical trial.</p>

Healthcare Services for Women with HIV Infection<br>
<font size=3>August 1995</font></h2>

<blockquote>
<font size=-1>

<p>Women's health care should be fully integrated into HIV primary care, including basic gynecologic examination, preventive health screening, and contraceptive counseling. These primary care services should be complemented by access to colposcopy and subspecialty care when indicated. The provision of services for women and children at the same location promotes access to care for all family members and fosters collaboration between members of the health care team.</p>

<p>General screening and treatment protocols for HIV infection require modification to meet the special needs of women with HIV infection. Certain conditions occur more frequently and may be more aggressive in women with HIV disease than in seronegative women.</p>

<p>These conditions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menstrual irregularities, including amenorrhea
<li>Genital ulcerative disease, which may increase the risk of HIV transmission
<li>Vulvovaginal yeast infections, which are often recurrent and refractory to local therapy
<li>Genital herpes, which is often recurrent and refractory to treatment, and which may indicate progression of immunodeficiency
<li>Human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause condyloma acuminata and cervical dysplasia
<ul>
<li>Dysplastic cervical lesions may progress more rapidly to in situ or invasive carcinoma in women with HIV infection
</ul>
<li>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which may have a subtle alteration in presentation and course in women with immunosuppression
<ul>
<li>This condition may be refractory to standard therapy in women with HIV infection and requires inpatient treatment
</ul></ul>
<hr size=4 align=center width=50%>

<p><b>COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION FOR WOMEN WITH HIV INFECTION HISTORY</b></p>

<p>In addition to a full medical and surgical history, the women's health
history should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Menstrual history (last menstrual period, regularity of menses, amenorrhea, menometrorrhagia, menopausal symptoms)
<li>Obstetric history (pregnancies with relevant histories, live births, miscarriages, terminations, age and health status of children, HIV status of children)
 <li>Family planning history (contraceptive use, termination of 
pregnancies, desire to have children)
<li>Sexual history (sexual practices, sexual abuse, nature and stability of current relationships, number and gender of partners, use of barrier protection, HIV prevention methods)
<li>Gynecologic history (previous diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases, vulvovaginal and pelvic infections, surgery, and other gynecological disorders)
<li>Cervical cancer screening [last Pap smear, frequency of Pap smears, abnormal Pap smear, colposcopy, cryotherapy, cone biopsy, LEEP (loop electrocision procedure), hysterectomy]
<li>Social history (current relationship with significant other, living arrangements, substance use, domestic violence)
<li>Current abdominal and pelvic symptoms (discharge, unusual odor, rash, genital ulcers, pain in urinary tract, urinary frequency)
</ul>

<hr size=4 align=center width=50%>

<p><b>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</b></p>

<p>In addition to the general physical examination, include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Breast examination
<li>Abdominal examination
<li>nspection of external genitalia (ulcerative lesions, genital warts, molluscum contagiosum, lymphadenopathy/lymphadenitis)
<li>Speculum exam (vaginal discharge or lesions, cervical erosions, lesions or discharge)
<li>Bimanual exam (cervical motion tenderness, adnexal and rectovaginal masses, fibroids)
<li>Rectal examination
<li>All infections, including vulvovaginal yeast infections, should be monitored for frequency and for response to treatment
</ul>

<hr size=4 align=center width=50%>

<p><b>LABORATORY/DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES</b><br>
Include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Urinalysis
<dt>Dipstick and microscopic analysis 
<li>Wet Mount
<dt>Evaluate vaginal and cervical discharge for:
<dt>– Trichomonas
<dt>– Bacterial vaginosis
<li>KOH Prep
<dt>Evaluate for vaginal candidiasis
<p>
<li><b>Syphilis Serologic Screening</b>
<dt>The majority of individuals with HIV infection and primary or secondary syphilis have reactive serology. False-negative results in the setting of active syphilis have been described, but usually become positive when the test is repeated.
<dt><b>POSITIVE SEROLOGY</b>
<ul>
<li>Confirm with treponemal serology (FTA-abs or MHA-TP)
<li>Review treatment history
<li>Review symptoms of primary, secondary, and neurologic syphilis
<li>Perform lumbar puncture as clinically indicated if any 
neurologic symptoms are present
</ul>
<dt><b>NEGATIVE SEROLOGY WITH LESIONS SUSPICIOUS FOR SYPHILIS</b>
<ul>
<li>Serology should be repeated one or two weeks after the initial negative result
<li>Biopsy of lesions may be diagnostic
<li>Darkfield microscopy of primary ulcerative lesions should be performed
<li>Wet mount and KOH evaluation of vaginal and cervical discharge should be conducted
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Gonorrhea and Chlamydia Testing</b>
<ul>
<li>Endocervical sampling should be done at least annually and more frequently as indicated. Approximately 50% of cases in women are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic.
<li>Repeat sampling should be done if there are symptoms, new sexual partners, possible exposure, or presence of another sexually transmitted disease.
<li>Sexual partners should be evaluated and treated in order to prevent reinfection.
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Papanicolaou Smears</b>
<dt>Pap smears should be repeated according to the following schedule:
<ul>
<li>Two times in the first year
<li>Annually when the initial two Pap smears are normal and 
reliability of follow-up is reasonably certain
<li>Every six months when there is a history of:
<dt>– HPV infection
<dt>– Previous Pap smear showing squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), or other cellular abnormalities
<dt>– Symptomatic HIV infection
<dt>If inflammation is noted, the patient should be treated and should have a repeat Pap smear. If sampling is inadequate, the Pap smear should be repeated immediately. If any degree of dysplasia is present, the patient should be referred to a trained colposcopist.
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Mammography</b>
<dt>The guidelines of the American Cancer Society, which are not particular to women with HIV, should be followed:
<dt>– Baseline study for women between 35 and 39
<dt>– Every other year through age 49
<dt>– Annual study for women age 50 and older
<dt>– Women with a first-degree relative with premenopausal breast cancer or other reasons for increased risk should have annual mammography after age 35.
<p>
<li><b>Pregnancy Test</b>
<dt>Conduct a pregnancy test if the patient's menstrual history, symptoms, and physical examination are suggestive of pregnancy. If the test is positive:
<ul>
<li>Counseling regarding pregnancy decisions should be nondirective.
<li>Sufficient information for the patient to make an informed decision about pregnancy options should be provided.
<li>Pregnant women with HIV infection should have information about, and access to, all interventions that may reduce the rate of perinatal HIV transmission. (See Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Zidovudine Therapy in Pregnancy to Reduce Perinatal Transmission of HIV, in protocol folder).
<li>Prompt referrals for prenatal care or termination of pregnancy should be made, according to the patient's choice.
</ul>
<p>
<dt><b>CONTRACEPTIVE COUNSELING</b>
<li>Clinicians should discuss contraception with all patients who are infected with HIV. All discussions about contraception should be accompanied by patient education about safer sex practices.
<li>Barrier contraception (condoms and spermicide) for vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse is recommended to reduce the transmission of HIV. However, the full range of options should be discussed.
<li>Some patients experience significant allergic reactions to latex condoms and to the spermicide nonoxynol-9. In addition, condoms may break. Therefore, recommendations to use condoms during intercourse may not be universally effective.
<li>Hormonal contraception (including birth control pills, Norplant® and Depo-Provera®) is not contraindicated in the setting of HIV infection.
<li>Use of hormonal therapy should be accompanied by use of barrier contraceptives (condoms, dental dams) to prevent HIVtransmission. Barrier techniques can be effective in preventing pregnancy if used consistently and properly.
<li>Rifampin and rifabutin are known to reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Concomitant use of these drugs may result in pregnancy.
<li>Intrauterine devices (IUDs) may be contraindicated in the setting of HIV infection. They may increase the risk of HIV transmission as a result of either increased menstrual blood flow or microabrasions on the head of the penis of the sexual partner.
<li>Surgical sterilization should neither be encouraged nor denied on the basis of HIV infection.
<li>The clinician should discuss the possible effects of HIV on pregnancy.
<li>Information regarding measures to prevent perinatal HIV transmission should be provided. Patients should be informed about the use of zidovudine to prevent perinatal transmission (See Clinical Guidelines  for the Use of Zidovudine Therapy in Pregnancy to Reduce Perinatal Transmission of HIV, in protocol folder).
<li>A referral for HIV follow-up care and prenatal care should be provided when appropriate.
<p>
<dt><b>OBSTETRICAL CARE</b>
<li>Currently there is no clear evidence of a direct deleterious effect of pregnancy and childbirth on the progression of HIV infection.
<li>The standard approach to the care of asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV positive women, including laboratory tests, skin tests, vaccinations and treatment, need not be altered because of pregnancy.
<ul>
<li>Pneumococcal vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine are recommended.
<li>Rubella vaccine is contraindicated.
<li>Treatment for tuberculosis should follow the New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) guidelines for pregnancy.

<li>Zidovudine should be recommended for the prevention of perinatal HIV transmission, as per the NYS DOH recommendations. (See Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Zidovudine Therapy in Pregnancy to Reduce Perinatal Transmission of HIV.)
<li>Pregnant women with HIVinfection should receive HIV primary care to help them maintain their own health during pregnancy.
<li>CD4 counts should be monitored at least once a trimester during pregnancy and again if an opportunistic infection develops.
<li>Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is recommended for all patients with a CD4 count less than 200/mm3 or a prior history of PCP.

<h2 align=center><img src="gifs/aix.gif"><br>HIV Medical Evaluation and Preventive Care <br>for Adolescents<br>
<font size=3>August 1995</font></h2>

<blockquote>
<font size=-1>

<p>Like all other adolescents, adolescents with HIV infection benefit from periodic health evaluations. Indeed, periodic comprehensive evaluations are critical for preventive care, for management of chronic illnesses, and for interventions to prevent opportunistic infections. Most health care for HIV-exposed youth is provided in the outpatient setting, involves multiple visits, and often requires more emotional support than does care for adults. Providers should also be familiar with consent issues associated with treating adolescents. Following are guidelines for the primary care of adolescents with HIV infection</p>

<HR>

<H3>Initial Comprehensive Medical Evaluation</H3>

<H4>GOALS</H4>

<ul>
<li>Provide general health care to adolescents with HIV infection.
<li>Stage HIV-disease manifestations for prognosis and treatment.
<li>Identify and prevent HIV-related opportunistic infections and related medical conditions.
<li>Identify psychosocial problems in the family that will affect the adolescent.
<li>Provide prevention, risk reduction, and health maintenance education
</ul>

<H4>EVALUATION</H4>

<p><b>Complete Medical History</b></p>

<p><I>Pay special attention to:</I></P> 

<ul>
<LI>MEDICAL HISTORY: symptoms of seroconversion illness, hospitalizations, infections, allergies, immunizations, reason for and source of referral, source of financial support for medical care, and HIV risk factors
<li>CONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS: fever, fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, lymphadenopathy

<li>UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS
</ul>

<H4>Comprehensive Physical Examination</H4> 

<p>A complete physical examination should be done at least every 3 months. This schedule should be adapted according to the health needs of the individual youth.</P> 

<p><I>Pay special attention to:</I></P> 

<ul>
<li>GENERAL: growth parameters (plotted on growth charts), general state of well-being, vital signs, weight loss or failure to gain weight, evidence of muscle wasting, adenopathy
<li>EYE: dilated funduscopic examination to look for exudates associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, toxoplasmosis
<li>SKIN: psoriasis, eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, molluscum contagiosum, dermatophytes, Kaposi's sarcoma
<li>ORAL: soft tissue exam, including evidence of herpes simplex, leukoplakia, candidiasis, aphthous ulcers, Kaposi's sarcoma, gingivitis, tooth decay

</ul>

<h4>REFERRALS</h4> 

<ul>
<li>Prompt referrals should be made to dentists and ophthalmologists when abnormal conditions are detected. Referrals to gynecologists, neurologists, and dermatologists should be readily available as needed to supplement the treatment offered by the primary care practitioner.
<li>Persons with &lt;50 CD4 cells/mm3 should be referred for a dilated funduscopic examination by an ophthalmologist.
</ul>

<h4>LABORATORY TESTS AND FOLLOW-UP</h4> 

<ul>
<li>HIV SEROLOGY: confirm if patients are seropositive
<li>COMPLETE BLOOD CELL COUNT (CBC) WITH DIFFERENTIAL AND PLATELET COUNT: evaluate every 3 months for total lymphocyte count, anemia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia
<li>IMMUNOLOGIC MONITORING: monitor CD4 (T4) count, total number and percentage of total lymphocyte count, initially and every 6 months; if CD4 count approaches 200/mm3, monitor every 3 months to evaluate need for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis
<li>HEPATITIS B SEROLOGY: determine need for immunization
<li>SYPHILIS SEROLOGY: repeat yearly
<li>RUBELLA TITER, SICKLE CELL PREPARATIONS, G6PD EVALUATION: perform at intake

<LI>If work-up is negative, exclude extrapulmonary disease and administer isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis for 9 months to 1 year
<LI>If patient has been exposed to drug-resistant TB, consult an infectious diseases specialist
</ul>
<LI>PPD negative, anergic: chest X-ray, TB exposure history, and past history of TB
<ul>
<LI>If past history of TB, exposure to TB, or positive chest X-ray, evaluate for active TB and consider extrapulmonary disease
<LI>If exposure history with negative chest X-ray, exclude extrapulmonary disease and administer prophylaxis
<LI>If no past history or exposure and negative chest X-ray, observe and monitor patient
</ul>
<LI>PPD negative, not anergic: do not administer prophylaxis.
</ul>
<li>FOR SEXUALLY ACTIVE ADOLESCENTS: Pap smear, cultures for gonorrhea, rapid fluorescent antibody test for Chlamydia trachomatis, wet mount preparation, KOH preparation, and pregnancy test as indicated; perform colposcopy for abnormal Pap smear.
</ul>

<HR>

<H3>Follow-up Care and Monitoring</H3> 

<p>Emphasize the importance of follow-up for adolescent patients with HIV, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, for health maintenance and preventive therapy.</P> 

<H4> GROWTH MONITORING </H4> 

<ul>
<li>Growth velocity with weight/height on charts
<li>Nutritional assessment/counseling

<ul>
<li>Adolescents at least 14 years old should have immunization for adult diphtheria and tetanus (dT), measles, mumps, and rubella.
<li>Adolescents who are hepatitis B seronegative should have immunization for hepatitis B.
<li>Pneumococcal vaccination should be given once.
<li>H. influenzae vaccination may be considered.
</ul>

<H4>ANTIRETROVIRALS</H4> 

<p>See Antiretroviral Therapy</P> 

<H4>MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES</H4> 

<p>HIV infection is only one of many stresses for adolescent patients and their families. Health care professionals should be knowledgeable about the medical management of HIV disease and related social, cultural, political, and legal issues. It is essential for the clinician to be able to counsel families about HIV confidentiality and to respond, as needed, to families in crisis.</P> 

<p>Access to financial, legal, and mental health services also should be provided, when needed.</P> 

<p>Special issues in the care of adolescent patients with HIV may include confidentiality, financial independence, homelessness, substance use, and sexual orientation.</P>

<H4>PREVENTION EDUCATION</H4> 

<p>Prevention education should be an integral part of care for all adolescents. In the context of HIV infection it should include discussion of sexual and other behavioral changes (abstinence, condom use, substance use), antiviral therapy, and the benefits of prospective health care.</P> 

<H4>PROPHYLAXIS FOR <i>PNEUMOCYSTISCARINII</i> PNEUMONIA (PCP)</H4> 

<p>Indications: Adolescents identified as HIV seropositive should be immunologically monitored and begun on PCP prophylaxis. CD4 guidelines for adults may be used to determine the need for PCP prophylaxis in adolescents.</P> 

<p>(Refer to the Prophylaxis for Opportunistic Infections protocol for prophylaxis regimens for PCP and other opportunistic infections.)</P>

<font size=-1>

<p>This protocol will discuss prophylaxis of the common opportunistic infections (OIs) of AIDS. Some of these infections can be prevented by avoiding exposure to the causative organism (i.e., salmonellosis and toxoplasmosis), while others are caused by organisms that are so ubiquitous thatexposure cannot be avoided and antimicrobial agents are necessary. Treatment of opportunistic infections and prevention of their recurrence are discussed in<i> Criteria for the Medical Care of Adults with HIV Infection and Criteria for the Medical Care of Children and Adolescents with HIV Infection</i>.</p>

<p>Strategies for the prophylaxis of OIs have become an important part of the ambulatory management of HIV disease. Generally, prophylaxis is indicated if the incidence of the disease is high; the disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality; the medications used for prophylaxis are safe, effective, and well tolerated over the long term; and widespread use of prophylaxis does not result in the emergence of drug-resistant organisms. Because the risk of most OIs associated with HIV infection increases with falling CD4 counts, most prophylactic interventions are based on specific CD4 criteria.</p>

<p>Currently, prophylaxis is widely recommended for tuberculosis (See Tuberculosis Management protocol), <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> pneumonia (PCP), and toxoplasmosis. Prophylaxis for <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex (MAC), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and disseminated fungal infection is available but more controversial, as will be discussed below. Prophylactic immunizations are discussed in the HIV Medical Evaluation and Preventive Care protocols for adults, adolescents, and children.</p>

<p>In each section of this protocol, adult and pediatric dosages are given. Most clinicians base dosages for adolescents on Tanner stage, not age. Adolescents classified as Tanner stage I or II should be treated according to pediatric guidelines. Treatment of Tanner stage IV adolescents and youth should follow adult guidelines. Treatment of Tanner stage III adolescents should be individualized.</p>
<hr>

<h3 align=center><u><a name="pcp">PNEUMOCYSTIS</a> CARINII PNEUMONIA</u></h3>

<p><i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> is a ubiquitous organism that causes devastating pneumonia in patients with late-stage HIV infection. Without prophylaxis, between 60% and 80% of people with AIDS have developed PCP during the course of their disease. Exposure to the organism cannot be avoided; most adults have acquired latent infection during childhood, and most cases of PCP are thought to result from activation of latent infection.</p>

 <h3><b><a name="indic">INDICATIONS</a> FOR PCP PROPHYLAXIS</b></h3>

<ul>
<li>Patients with a prior episode of PCP or other AIDS-defining Illnesses. <li>Patients with AIDS diagnosed by a CD4 count <200/mm<sup>3</sup> or <14% total circulating lymphocytes.
</ul> <i>Consider prophylaxis for:</i>
<ul>
Patients with symptoms of AIDS-related complex, including thrush, fever, diarrhea, and weight loss, irrespective of CD4 count.

<p>Patients with a rapidly dropping CD4 count, even if it is not yet <200/mm<sup>3</sup> or <14%. Since cases of PCP have been reported with CD4 counts between 200/mm<sup>3</sup> and 300/mm<sup>3</sup>, someclinicians start prophylaxis when CD4 counts are between these values. </p>

<h3><a name="drug">DRUG</a> REGIMENS FOR PCP PROPHYLAXIS</h3>

<h3><b><a name="tmp">Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole</a></b></h3>

<p>For patients who are able to tolerate it, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the drug of choice for PCP prophylaxis. It is more effective than aerosolized pentamidine and oral dapsone, and it is much less expensive than aerosolized pentamidine. It offers significant protection against AIDS-associated opportunistic infections other than PCP, including toxoplasmosis, isosporiasis, and certain bacterial infections.</p>

<ul><b>Dosage and Administration</b><br>

Most studies that confirm the efficacy of prophylactic TMP-SMX have used doses of one DS tablet b.i.d. or one DS tablet daily. One SS tablet daily and one DS tablet three times weekly also seem to be effective dosages. For pediatric dosage, see Table 2, below. (Also see <i>Criteria for the Medical Care of Children and Adolescents with HIV Infection</i>.)
</ul>

<h4 align=center>Pediatric Dosage<br>
<a name="table2">Table 2</a><br>

Drug Regimens for PCP prophylaxis for Children &gt; 4 weeks of age</h4>

<p>(Reprint from: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. MMWR. April 28, 1995. Vol. 44 No. RR-4.)</h4>

<p><b>Recommended regimen:</b></p>

<p>Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 150 mg TMP/m<sup>2</sup>/day with 750 mg SMX/m<sup>2</sup>/day administered orally in divided doses twice a day (b.i.d.) 3 times per week on consecutive days (e.g., Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday).</p>

<p><b>Acceptable alternative TMP-SMX dosage schedules:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>l 150 mg TMP/m<sup>2</sup>/day with 750 mg SMX/m<sup>2</sup>/day administered orally as a <b>single daily dose</b> 3 times per week on consecutive days (e.g., Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday).
<p>
<li>l 150 mg TMP/m<sup>2</sup>/day with 750 mg SMX/m<sup>2</sup>/day orally divided b.i.d. and <b>administered 7 days per week</b>.
<p><li>l 150 mg TMP/m<sup>2</sup>/day with 750 mg SMX/m<sup>2</sup>/day administered orally divided b.i.d. and given 3 times per week on <b>alternate days</b> (e.g., Monday-Wednesday-Friday).
</ul>

<p><b>Alternative Regimens if TMP-SMX not tolerated</b>:
<ul>
<li>
<p> <b>Dapsone*</b> 2mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) administered orally once daily.
<p>
<li><b>Aerosolized pentamidine</b>* (children 5 years of age or older) 300 mg administered<br>
via Respirgard II inhaler monthly.
</ul>

<p><i>*If neither dapsone nor aerosolized pentamidine are tolerated, some clinicians use intravenous pentamidine (4mg/kg) administered every 2 or 4 weeks.</i></p>

<hr>

<p><b><a name="preg">Use</a> in pregnancy</b><br>
TMP-SMX is a Category C drug in pregnancy (risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out). The drug has had teratogenic effects in animal models but there have been no reports of teratogenicity when it has been used for PCP prophylaxis in pregnant women. Used late in pregnancy, it may predispose the infant to neonatal jaundice. 

<p><b>Side effects</b><br>

Approximately 50% of adults with HIV infection are unable to tolerate TMP-SMX because of rash, itching, fevers, hepatitis, or myelosuppression. In some cases, mild side effects can be managed symptomatically (with antihistamines and topical steroid preparations), and they will resolve. With severe side effects, however, the drug must be discontinued, since some TMP-SMX reactions can be life-threatening. Reinstituting the drug in a desensitization protocol is possible for adults with mild reactions to TMP-SMX (See <a href="#desens">below</a>).

<p><b>Monitoring</b><br>

Complete blood cell counts and serum liver enzymes should be monitored periodically in patients on TMP-SMX, especially during the first 2 months of therapy.</ul> <hr>

<h3><a name="dap">Dapsone</a></h3>

<p>Oral dapsone is a safe and effective means of preventing PCP, although it appears to be somewhat less effective than oral TMP-SMX. In combination with pyrimethamine, dapsone is also effective in the prevention of toxoplasmosis. Patients who fail dapsone prophylaxis and develop PCP may present with atypical chest X-rays and negative gallium scans of the chest.

<ul><b>Dosage and Administration</b><br>
100 mg daily is the most effective dosage of dapsone for PCP prophylaxis. Some studies have found 100 mg t.i.w. to be effective; 50 mg daily seems to be a less effective dosage.

<p><b>Pediatric Dosage</b><br>
(See <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>) Dapsone prophylaxis for PCP in children has not been proven. However, breakthrough cases in children treated with dapsone have been reported.

<p><b>Use in pregnancy</b><br>
Dapsone is a Category C drug in pregnancy (risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out). No instances of teratogenicity have been reported when pregnant women with leprosy have been treated with dapsone.

<p><b>Side effects</b><br>
Dapsone may cause rash, fever, and hepatitis in people with HIV infection. It may cause hemolysis and rarely will cause severe hemolytic crises in patients with G6PD deficiency. Approximately 15% of African-Americans are G6PD deficient; this condition is also common in persons of Mediterranean origin.

<p><b>Monitoring</b><br>
G6PD should be assayed in all patients prior to beginning dapsone treatment, and the drug should not be given to persons who are G6PD deficient. Complete blood cell counts and serum liver enzymes should be monitored periodically in patients receiving dapsone.</ul> <hr> <h3><a name="pent">Pentamidine</a></h3>

<p>Aerosolized pentamidine is no longer considered a first-line drug for prophylaxis of PCP, although it appears to be acceptably effective in patients with CD4 counts >100. Unlike TMP-SMX and dapsone, pentamidine confers no protection against extrapulmonary <i>P. carinii</i> infection, and no protection against other AIDS-related opportunistic infections. It is, however, considerably better tolerated by patients with HIV infection than either of the two other drugs. Patients failing aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis may present with characteristic upper-lobe PCP due to the drug's failure to penetrate to the apices of the lungs.

<p>Intravenous and intramuscular administration of pentamidine have been used for PCP prophylaxis but should be initiated only in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist.

<ul><b>Dosage and Administration</b><br>

300 mg (one vial) of pentamidine is mixed with 6 cc sterile water and administered via a Respirgard II<sup>.</sup> nebulizer once monthly. During administration of aerosolized pentamidine, patients should be placed in a semi-Trendelenburg position and encouraged to roll onto their left and right sides in order to distribute the drug into all areas of the lung.

<p><b>Pediatric dosage</b><br>

 For children 5 years old and older, dosage is the same as for adults. Efficacy is not proven in children below age 5, although some clinicians use doses of 4 mg/kg q 2-4 weeks. (Also see <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>)

<p><b>Use in pregnancy</b><br>
Pentamidine is a Category C drug in pregnancy (risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out). Since little systemic absorption of the drug occurs, risk to the fetus is probably quite low.

<p><b>Side effects</b><br>
Inhaled pentamidine may cause cough and bronchospasm, particularly among patients with preexisting bronchospastic disease. It has been very rarely associated with pancreatitis and hypoglycemia.

<p><b>Monitoring</b><br>
Before the initiation of pentamidine treatment, active pulmonary tuberculosis must be ruled out. Patients who have coughed during pentamidine treatments have caused nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis.

<p>The lungs should be auscultated prior to and during the administration of each aerosolized pentamidine treatment. Beta-agonist aerosols should be available for use during treatment.</ul> <hr>

<h3><a name="desens">Desensitization</a></h3>
<p>Pruritis and rash caused by TMP-SMX are much more frequent in people with HIV infection than in others. In most cases, these reactions are caused not by an allergy, but by an abnormality in the hepatic metabolism of sulfonamides that leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites of the drug. The rationale for desensitization is that a slow introduction of TMP-SMX will induce hepatic enzymes so that a standard dose can be effectively metabolized.</p>

<p>More than 50% of people with HIV infection who cannot tolerate sulfa drugs can be successfullydesensitized to tolerate TMP-SMX. Any patient with a previous mild-to-moderate reaction to the drug is a candidate for desensitization: severe allergic reactions to TMP-SMX are no more common in these people than in those with no prior reaction to the drug. <b>People with prior severe or life-threatening reactions to TMP-SMX should not be enrolled in desensitization protocols.</b></p>

<p>If the drug is to be administered for the treatment of PCP, rapid (one-day) desensitization protocols are often used. However, if the drug is to be used for prophylaxis, protocols that take days or weeks are reasonable alternatives.</p>

<p>Desensitization has not been definitively proven to be safer or more effective than direct rechallenge with TMP-SMX. Studies addressing this issue are under way.</p>

<p>Two desensitization protocols follow that may be useful to practitioners who would like to administer TMP-SMX to previously intolerant patients. Neither protocol is specifically favored by the AIDS Institute. Although no published controlled studies have examined the relative efficacy of these protocols, both have proven successful in small studies.</p>

<h3 align=center><a name="toxo">TOXOPLASMOSIS</a></h3>
<p>Toxoplasmosis in AIDS results from reactivation of latent infection. Patients who are seropositive for toxoplasmosis are at risk of developing disease as their immune system fails. Patients who are seronegative for toxoplasmosis are at minimal risk of developing toxoplasmosis, but they should be counseled about ways to avoid exposure to the organism.

<p><h4>Toxoplasmosis-negative patients</h4>
<p>Patients with HIV infection who have negative toxoplasmosis IgG titers should be advised to avoid eating raw and undercooked meat, especially pork and lamb, and should avoid handling raw meat. Contact with cat feces and cat litter should be minimized and cat litter boxes should be frequently sterilized with boiling water. Since exposure to toxoplasmosis can occur despite these precautions, toxoplasmosis serology should be repeated every year.

<p><h4>Toxoplasmosis-positive patients</h4>
<p>A positive IgG for toxoplasmosis, no matter what the magnitude of the titer, means that a person with HIV infection is at a 10-30 percent risk of developing toxoplasmosis when the CD4 cell count declines below 75-100. In persons with positive <i>Toxoplasma</i> serology, the test need not be repeated. These persons are automatically candidates for toxoplasmosis prophylaxis when the CD4 count falls below 100.

<p>Prevention of recurrent toxoplasmosis is not the same as prophylaxis of first occurrence of disease. Primary prophylaxis regimens are not adequate as suppressive therapy after toxoplasmosis. In that circumstance, therapy should be continued with principal antitoxoplasma drug regimens (sulfadiazine/pyrimethamine plus leucovorin or clindamycin/pyrimethamine plus leucovorin).

<p><ul><b>Pediatric Patients</b><br>
Clinicians do not generally use prophylactic therapy for children who are seropositive for <i>T. gondii</i>. Since there is limited experience with these regimens, consultation with a specialist is recommended.</ul>

<h3 align=center>Drug regimens for Toxoplasmosis Prophylaxis</h3>

 <h3>Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole</h3>
<p>TMP-SMX appears to be effective prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis at the dosages that are used for PCP prophylaxis. No additional agents are required. (See <a href="#preg">above</a> for use of TMP-SMX in pregnancy and for other considerations.)

 <h3>Pyrimethamine</h3>
<p>Pyrimethamine appears to be effective prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis used in combination with dapsone. The vitamin leucovorin (folinic acid) is routinely administered with pyrimethamine to prevent leukopenia.

<ul><p><b>Dosage and Administration</b><br>
Dapsone 50-100 mg/day + pyrimethamine 50 mg/week + leucovorin 25 mg/week

<p><b>Use in Pregnancy</b><br>
Pyrimethamine is a Category C drug. It has teratogenic effects in animals, but no adequate human studies are available.

<p><b>Side Effects</b><br>
Pyrimethamine can cause anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. These effects may be lessened by concomitant administration of leucovorin.

<p><b>Monitoring</b><br>
Patients receiving pyrimethamine should be monitored with monthly CBCs. <br>For persons unable to receive TMP/SMX or dapsone, consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended to determine an alternative regimen, if any.</ul> <hr>

<h3 align=center><a name="mac">MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM COMPLEX</a></h3>
<p>Infection with <i>Mycobacterium avium complex</i> (MAC) can cause a febrile wasting illness in people with late-stage AIDS. Exposure to these ubiquitous organisms, which have been found in tap water, soil, and dust, cannot be avoided. Patients are at risk of MACdisease when CD4 counts fall below 75, especially after other opportunistic infections have been diagnosed.

<p>Both rifabutin and clarithromycin have been considered for prophylaxis against MAC. The efficacy and indications for clarithromycin have not yet been established. Although rifabutin has been confirmed to be effective in reducing the frequency of MAC by about 50%, its use is somewhat controversial. The drug does not change the mortality rates of late-stage AIDS. Furthermore, many clinicians are extremely concerned about the emergence of organisms resistant to rifabutin. Specifically, the use of rifabutin may result in rifampin-resistant <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infections in patients with unsuspected TB who receive the drug. For this reason, many clinicians feel that MAC prophylaxis in places with high rates of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection is too risky to be widely used. In these areas, decisions regarding prophylaxis are made on a case-by-case basis. Persons with CD4 cell counts &lt; 75/mm<sup>3</sup>, especially those who have had other opportunistic infections, are candidates for MAC prophylaxis.

<p><b>Dosage and Administration</b><br>
Rifabutin 300 mg p.o. once a day.</p>

<p><b>Pediatric Dosage</b><br>
MAC prophylaxis with rifabutin has been recommended by the CDC for consideration in adolescents and children with severely depressed CD4 counts (MMWR Vol.42 No.RR-9). The CD4 count at which prophylaxis should be considered for young children has not been fully described. Many experienced pediatric HIV providers use the following CD4 counts as guides for initiation of MAC prophylaxis: </p>

<center><table border=1 width=40%><tr>
<th><font size=-1>AGE</font></th>
<th><font size=-1>CD4 COUNT</font></th>
</tr><p><tr>
<td align=center><font size=-1>&lt; 2 years</td>
<td align=center><font size=-1>&lt; 200/mm<sup>3</sup></td>
</tr><p><tr>
<td align=center><font size=-1>2 years and older</td>
<td align=center><font size=-1>&lt; 100/mm<sup>3</sup></td>
</tr><p>
</table></center>

<p><b>Regimen</b>: Rifabutin 5 mg/kg as a single daily dose, not to exceed 300 mg/day.</p>

<p>As of 1995, rifabutin was not available in a commercially prepared pediatric preparation. An experienced pharmacist, however, may formulate it as a suspension (10 mg/cc).</p>

<p><b>Use in Pregnancy</b><br>
Rifabutin is a Category C drug. No information regarding its possible teratogenicity is available.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects</b><br>
Rifabutin has caused uveitis, especially when it is used at dosages > 300 mg/day or in conjunction with fluconazole. Rifabutin may cause arthralgias, arthritis, and hepatitis. Like rifampin, rifabutin is a powerful inducer of liver enzymes that metabolize other drugs, and it will interfere with the therapeutic effects of warfarin, dilantin, methadone, birth-control pills, and other drugs. Patients should be warned that the drug will turn urine and other body fluids red and can stain soft contact lenses.</p>

<p><b>Monitoring</b><br>
Tuberculosis must be excluded before rifabutin is administered for MAC prophylaxis. Disseminated MAC infection must also be excluded. Periodic liver function tests should be performed.

<hr>

 <h3 align=center><a name="cmv">CYTOMEGALOVIRUS</a></h3>

<p>Almost all people with HIV infection have serologic evidence of past infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV IgG antibody). Thus, the rare person with HIV infection who tests negative for CMV antibody should be advised to avoid exposure to the virus by using barrier methods for sexual contact and washing hands thoroughly after diapering infants and small children. If patients with HIV infection who are seronegative for CMV require blood transfusions, the blood should, if possible, be negative for CMV antibodies or should be composed of leukocyte-depleted cells.</p>

<p>People with HIV infection who are seropositive for CMV are at risk of developing reactivated CMV infections of their eyes, gastrointestinal tract, or other organs as their CD4 cells drop. Most CMV infections occur when CD4 cell counts fall below 50/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Although CMV prophylaxis for seropositive persons is not recommended at this time, short-term studies have shown that oral ganciclovir administered at a dose of 1 g t.i.d can halve the frequency of CMV retinitis in seropositive persons with CD4 cells <50/mm<sup>3</sup>. The use of this medication for prophylaxis is controversial for many reasons, including its expense and its potential for inducing ganciclovir resistance in CMV isolates and acyclovir resistance in herpes simplex virus isolates.</p>

<p>Oral acyclovir is ineffective in preventing CMV disease in people with HIV infection.</p>

<hr>

 <h3 align=center><a name="fungal">FUNGAL INFECTIONS</a></h3>

<h4>Oral and Vaginal Candidiasis</h4>

<p><i>Candida</i> organisms are ubiquitous on skin and mucosal surfaces. Because thrush and vaginal candidiasis are not life-threatening infections and are usually easily treated, prophylaxis against them is not recommended. However, if a patient experiences frequent episodes of these infections, ongoing suppressive therapy may be helpful.</p>

<p>The clinician should remember that fluconazole resistance is becoming increasingly common in persons who receive this drug on a long-term basis. These infections are very difficult to treat.</p>

 <h4>Invasive Fungal Disease</h4>

<p>The common invasive fungal diseases in HIV infection include cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis. <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is an omnipresent environmental organism. No practical method to avoid exposure to it has been identified. <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i> and <i>Coccidioides immitis</i> are common soil organisms in certain areas of the Uni<i>ted States. Histoplasma capsulatum</i> can be found in the Midwest, along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, and in parts of the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico. <i>Coccidioides immitis</i> is present in the desert regions of the Southwest, especially the San Joaquin Valley. Some clinicians administer itraconazole to people with HIV infection who have spent long periods of time in areas endemic for histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis in order to prevent reactivated disease. The safety and efficacy of this practice have not been validated.</p>

<h4>Cryptococcosis</h4>

<p>Oral fluconazole at a dosage of 200 mg/day has been shown effective in reducing the incidence of cryptococcosis in people with HIV infection who have <200 CD4 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Concerns about this practice include the relative rarity of cryptococcal infections in AIDS, the expense and toxicity of the drug, and the emergence of drug resistance, particularly among Candida and other types of yeasts. Most clinicians make decisions regarding the prophylaxis of cryptococcosis in people with HIV infection on a case-by-case basis.</p>

 <hr>

 <h3 align=center><a name="adv">ADVISING YOUR PATIENTS</a></h3>

<p>People with HIV infection can actively avoid exposure to some of the organisms that cause opportunistic disease. For this reason, patients should be included in planning prevention strategies that decrease the risk of exposure to a pathogen.</p>

<p>Safer sex practices, adherence to sanitary measures during food preparation, and careful handling of cats may all help prevent infection. Syphilis, herpes simplex infections, CMV infections, and enteric infections, including cryptosporidiosis, may all be acquired through sexual contact. Cats may carry <i>Bartonella henselae</i> (the agent of cat-scratch fever) and <i>T. gondii</i>. Careful handling and thorough cooking of raw meat and poultry is recommended to prevent toxoplasmosis and enteric bacterial infections such as salmonellosis, shigellosis, and campylobacter infection. Education about prevention of exposure to these organisms is important even for those persons who have previously been exposed, especially to CMV, HSV, and TB, to prevent transmission to others.</p>

<h2 align=center><img src="gifs/aix.gif"><br>ABOUT THE AIDS INSTITUTE<br>
<font size=3>NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH</font></h2>

<blockquote><font size=-1>
<p>The AIDS Institute, a center within the New York State Department of Health, was created in 1983 by legislative mandate as the central agency for coordinating New York State's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  The Institute plans, funds, and evaluates HIV prevention and health care programs; educates the public; trains health care providers and counselors; and develops policy. </p>

<p>The Institute administers federal and state money for HIV/AIDS clinical care, counseling and testing, and public and professional education through two complementary funding mechanisms: enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rates and a wide variety of grants.</p>

<p>The enhanced Medicaid rates cover the increased cost of primary, acute, long-term, foster, and home care for adults and children with HIV infection or AIDS.  Grants fill service gaps, support care for uninsured persons, and encourage the development of new programs.  They are available to health care facilities, community-based organizations, and educational institutions to fund prevention programs, HIV counseling and testing, clinical education, HIV primary care and medications, development of adult day care and chronic care programs, supportive housing for persons with TB/HIV, and many other activities.</p>

<h3>MAJOR INITIATIVES</h3>

<p><b>EDUCATION AND TRAINING</b><br>
The Institute develops and supports a broad range of programs to train health professionals, HIV counselors, and others who work with people infected with HIV. It develops curricula and instructional materials, presents conferences and counselor training sessions, and distributes clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>

<p>To address the acute shortage of health care professionals in HIV care, the Institute has implemented the HIV Clinical Scholars Program.  The program supports the training of eligible physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners at Designated AIDS Centers.  Clinical scholars gain expertise in HIV care by working with a clinical mentor and through practice in a variety of hospital and community settings.</p>

<p>The Clinical Education Initiative funded through the AIDS Institute provides grants to hospitals and community health centers statewide for the development of provider education opportunities and for the presentation of conferences and seminar series. </p>

<p><b>COUNSELING AND TESTING</b><br>
The Institute makes every effort to concentrate programs in high HIV seroprevalence areas and to integrate HIV counseling and testing with other services. Confidential counseling and testing, with partner notification and referrals to medical and social services, are available at community health centers, substance use programs, county health departments, sexually transmitted disease/tuberculosis clinics, hospitals and from private physicians.</p>

<p>Anonymous HIV counseling and testing services are available at almost seventy sites statewide, such as community organizations, drug treatment programs, and housing projects, and via a mobile van throughout New York City.</p>

<p>The Institute's Obstetrical Initiative provides counseling and voluntary testing to women who have received little or no prenatal care, and facilitates access to a range of services, including drug treatment and social services for women with HIV infection and their children.</p>

<p>Through the Criminal Justice Initiative, the Institute has established training programs for prison staff and inmates, along with counseling and testing.</p>

<p><b>HOSPITAL-BASED SERVICES</b><br>
Designated AIDS Centers (DACs) are hospitals with comprehensive AIDS services and formal links to community organizations.  In 1991, AIDS Centers accounted for 53% of all HIV-related hospital discharges in New York State. Currently, there are twenty-four DACs with three more pending final designation.</p>

<p>Pediatric/Maternal Centers offer multi-disciplinary, family-focused care to address the full range of medical and social needs of families. Twenty-one Pediatric/Maternal Centers currently exist, and grants have been awarded for four additional Centers.</p>

<p><b>AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (ADAP)</b><br>
Since 1987, the federally funded ADAP has provided free HIV/AIDS medications to medically and financially eligible persons not covered by Medicaid or other insurance. More than 1,500 pharmacies participate in the program with over 50 drugs in the ADAP formulary.  Over l6,000 people have enrolled in ADAP and over 7,000 individuals are currently active.
ADAP Plus (HIV Primary Care Uninsured Pool) provides payment for primary care for New York State residents with HIV infection.  Open to persons without insurance or Medicaid coverage, the program covers comprehensive outpatient care.  Over 2,000 people are enrolled in the program.</p>

<p><b>COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS</b><br>
The AIDS Institute supports a broad variety of programs provided by community-based organizations and health centers for persons with HIV infection.  The programs offer prevention, HIV primary care, and support services to women, gay/bisexual men, drug users, minorities, adolescents, homeless persons, and the general community.</p>

<p>The organizations perform outreach, risk reduction training, counseling, case management, and crisis intervention and provide referrals for medical care, housing, transportation, and nutrition.  They provide medical respite and day care for children, home-delivered meals to persons with HIV/AIDS, and legal counsel.</p>

<p>Through the HIV Enhanced Fees for Physicians Program, private physicians receive enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rates for HIV counseling and testing and clinical follow-up of persons with HIV.
Under its Case Management (Community Follow-up) Programs, the Institute supports agencies and organizations which provide intensive, family-centered case management services to people with HIV/AIDS.  These programs seek to prevent premature institutionalization by increasing access to needed medical and human services.</p>

<p>Ryan White Title II funding supports regional <a href="../network/access/states/ny/care.html">HIV Care Networks</a> throughout the state for communities and localities to improve planning, program development, and service delivery for individuals and families affected by AIDS/HIV.  The Networks include health care and support service providers, persons with HIV/AIDS and their advocacy organizations, public health providers, and non-profit medical care providers. Each HIV Network establishes a provider consortium to assess regional service needs, develop plans to address these needs, and to provide a forum for information exchange.</p>

<p><b>PLANNING AND EVALUATION</b><br>
The AIDS Intervention Management System (AIMS) program was established to conduct surveillance, quality assurance, and utilization review of services provided by Designated AIDS Center hospitals.  The program has expanded to include regulatory and programmatic monitoring of standards of care for people with HIV/AIDS in all health care facilities receiving enhanced Medicaid rates.</p>

<p><b>POLICY</b><br>
The Institute has been a leader in discussions and development of policy for nearly every important HIV issue, including discrimination, confidentiality, immigration, and most recently, the CDC definition of AIDS, tuberculosis and HIV, and the management of health care workers with HIV infection.</p>

<h3 align=center>It Isn't Over 'til It's Over</h3>
<h5 align=center>by John Hatchet</h5>

<p>Several years ago I made a conscious decision to stop trying to count the number of friends and acquaintances I’ve lost to AIDS.  There were simply too many people, and too much loss, and I was beginning to feel weighed down by the numbers themselves, in addition to the people.  Living in a community of people with AIDS and HIV, the losses extend past my immediate personal network to include co-workers and people I may not even have known personally, but whose lives and work were familiar and in some way or other important to me, and although I felt their deaths in a way that was different, it was no less real.</p>

<p>In each of the last three years, I’ve lost someone very close: in ‘93, my best friend of 15 years; in ‘94, my ex-lover, who’d introduced me to PWAC and the PWA self-empowerment movement; and this year, my co-worker and friend Michael.  Each of these deaths was unique, personal, requiring it’s own cycle of mourning, yet still part of a larger experience of loss.</p>

<p>I’m often asked by friends and family not connected to our community how we are able to “keep going” in the midst of all this loss.  Much of the time what I really hear them asking is not how, but why, why do we keep going? why don’t we just give up? quit? find something else to do?  My first reaction always seems to be: “What’s the option?  I don’t feel like there’s a choice.”  And I usually explain about my own reasons for staying involved and about how I benefit from being a part of this community.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t answer those who are genuinely asking about the “how.”  They want to understand the process that helps us get through the pain. That answer is much longer and more complex, because everyone’s process is uniquely his or hers, and what is essential for some is impossible for others.  Memorial services are a classic example of what I mean. Several years ago I also decided that memorials were more difficult than helpful to me, and that I couldn’t take any more - at least not as a rule.  But then I found that for some of my losses, a collective experience of some sort was necessary for me to begin to move past the paralyzing pain I felt.  It didn’t take it away, to be sure, but for reasons I still can’t quite explain, it made a huge difference in my own process of grieving.</p>

<p>Most of the above discussion has to do with death, but grief and mourning accompany many more aspects of living with AIDS, or even simply living, and most of us don’t give much thought to those other areas.  Every human being experiences all sorts of losses throughout life, losses that are mourned in one way or another, conscious or not.  For people living with AIDS, the losses of a lifetime seem to get compressed into a shorter-than-usual time span: loss of physical strength and/or independence; loss of resources; loss of body image; for many, loss of family and/or community support; and all too often, loss of hope.  Each of these demands its own adjustment, and each one takes its toll.  A new version of the world has to be accepted and dealt with, in whatever ways are available to us.</p>

<p>The loss of hope may be the most constant of all.  I don’t particularly buy the notion of anticipatory grief, because it seems to me that we always grieve something in the present, some current experience, rather than something that’s ahead.  I think that when we grieve for something or someone that isn’t yet actually gone, we’re feeling the loss of hope that that person or thing will continue to be a part of our lives - it’s not the future that makes us so incredibly sad and angry, it’s feeling robbed of the expectation that we’ll have them in our lives indefinitely.  And that’s very much in the present.</p>

<p>It’s much too easy to say that the most important thing is not to deny our feelings.  Sometimes that’s exactly what we have to do to survive.  Denial can be a very important coping tool.  That’s one reason communal gatherings like memorials provoke such mixed feelings - we need to be able to deal with our losses on our own timetables, in our own ways, and trying to force the issue often does more harm than good.</p>

<p>I can’t say exactly what it is that eventually helps me turn the corner.  There is some comfort in knowing I’m not alone in the experience, and having work or other interests also helps remind me that my own life is continuing, regardless of how it may feel.  Maddeningly, the old saw about time healing all wounds is probably the most critical truth about mourning - it takes what it takes.</p>

<p>Some losses never completely heal, but with enough time, usually, there comes a moment when I realize that a comment or event or thought that a week earlier would have provoked tears for a lost friend or an unbearable sensation of heaviness in my chest, instead results in a sad smile or even a genuine laugh.  The pain may not ever go away altogether, but it does get better.  Sometimes that’s the best I can hope for.</p>

<p>Dear <i>Newsline</i>:</p>
<p align=right>I would like to offer congratulations for a job well done! You have truly outdone yourselves in the September 1995 issue of “AIDS in Prison.” I’m not saying this because my latest letter to you was part of this issue. No, I am speaking on behalf of all PWAs who are incarcerated. Thank you for giving us a way for our voices to be heard, and thank you for helping to make the public aware that we are being affected very hard in prisons. The public  doesn’t think about us when they talk about this epidemic.</p>
<p align=right>If it wasn’t for you, we might never be thought of except by our family and loved ones. Newsline is the only magazine that I’ve read or heard of that brings such a direct view from so many areas and people infected and affected. Believe me when I  say this because I receive information, correspondence, magazines, newsletters, etc. from AIDS organizations across this country. I like to be kept up to date on all aspects of this virus and how it’s affecting others who are dealing with it. I also want to salute all those who are dealing with it positively! Thank you for taking a stand for those who are either afraid or lack the knowledge. I’m talking about all the activists, educators and advocates out there. If it wasn’t for you, we would still be in the dark ages.</p>
<p align=right>The article by Kyle Beard (September 1995) really touched me the most. In my opinion, Kyle really did an excellent job in describing the problems that PWAs deal with on a daily basis. I myself have only known about my HIV status for 5 years, and I don’t think I was infected much sooner. Kyle really hit home with me on what he said. Kyle, you brought to light what many others refuse to see and realize.</p>
<p align=right>Thank you all who are taking a stand. Thank you for helping us to realize that we are not alone, and thank you for at least attempting to make a difference. Please don’t ever give up and stop, because as long as we stand united we will succeed! We must stay strong and keep hope. We will succeed!</p>
<p align=right>Sincerely, James Kiminecz, Florida</p>

<p align=center>*</p>

<p>Dear <i>Newsline</i>:</p>
<p align=right>If I knew there was going to be a special issue on AIDS in Prison (September 1995), I would have definitely contributed to it, but I see several of my longtime comrades had, especially the warm and thoughtful remembrances made of me by Danny Diaz. But you have always been a clarion of our struggles and needs and I commend your efforts and work greatly.</p>
<p align=right>I particularly enjoyed reading the issue on AIDS/HIV and Pregnancy (July/August 1995), especially the vibrant and enlightening testimony given by Michelle. I will keep her in my prayers. This is an issue of importance for all of us and our future and should not be neglected. I give high praise to Willie and Vivian for their self-determination and fortitude to go forward with the desires of their heart, and not to be swayed by the ignorance and prejudice of others.</p>
<p align=right>The prison I am now in is the most brutal and violent in the state, one that I was transferred out of five years ago before winding up at Green Haven, where I co-founded PACE/Green Haven. They have no AIDS education programs here, no violence awareness or alternatives to violence programs, and the facility has recently become host for death row. For the past few years, I have been writing that New York state does not need a legislated death penalty, when it already has an unlegislated one — its inhumane treatment of prisoners with AIDS/HIV. New York State is still the state with the second largest amount of people executed, and it has not had a death penalty for 30 years. More prisoners have died from AIDS in the last 6 years than all the people previously executed under the death penalty. Wake up New York, and the smell the coffee. This is not a measure to reduce crime and the prison population which has tripled since 1982. It’s genocide!</p>
<p align=right>I highly commend the honorable efforts to portray the truth, to enlighten, and to be vanguard for many who have been rejected by a  society that has been blinded by a corrupt right-wing administration. I send my love and deepest regards to all the staff at PWAC NY, and to all my fellow prisoners in solidarity in this struggle. There is no freedom without struggle! Take care and remain strong and committed.</p>
<p align=right>Sincerely, Yusuf A. Shakoor</p>

<h2 align=center><i>from the editor</i></h2>

<p>I have died many times to be reborn into a different person. The day I tested positive for HIV the person I was before died, and a new, stronger person was reborn. Every time I lose a friend to AIDS, a part of me dies and a part is reborn. Every time I experience a new health issue, a part of my spirit dies leaving a place for new parts to be born. What the hell does this mean?  It means life is filled with change and disappointment. It means that no matter what I will experience pain and grief that will continue to mold me into the person I am and want to be.</p>

<p>This month’s Newsline focuses on the difficult issues of grief. But, don’t think it will be a bummer, for it is necessary to address feelings that are scary and uncomfortable. I asked Jeanne Mischo, who has contributed her art work many times in the past to do the cover. Jeanne asked me what the lead story was so she could stick with the theme. I told her it was grief. A week later Jeanne sends the cover and on the front are the words “Grief and Healing.”  “Wow,” I thought! Jeanne, who does not work in the field of AIDS but is very dedicated, looked to the solution of grief — Healing! I love the word healing because it evokes a feeling of closure to the pain that grief brings.

<p>I want to share a personal story about me with you. In September my lover decided to leave our relationship. She told me on the phone from back home that she couldn’t do it. I was shocked, angry, hurt, and felt utter abandonment. I must be honest in expressing that I really did think I was going to die the following week. I had moments when I sat on the floor in my apartment and cried like a baby. I had moments when I wished I would just get sick and die. I was, for the first time in my life, allowing myself to be in the moment and feel my pain.</p>

<p>You see, it became clear that all these intense feelings of pain were not solely because I had been abandoned. All my pain seemed fresh, but also old pain from years of grief engulfed me. It took this person who I was willing to share the rest of my life with to say to me “I do not want you,” to get me into a place that is allowing me to heal and discover a new me. It is not easy! I have had to reach out to other I barely know. I was forced to stop calling back home due to an expensive phone bill and reach out to new friends in New York. It was odd to cry and be vulnerable with these new friends. But, they were so supportive and continue to be.</p>

<p>Let me tell you something that sounds a bit crazy. After losing so many friends to AIDS I began to pull away from others. I then found myself in a relationship where I focused all my love and attention on this one person. I had some idea that if I invested myself in one person I would have control over being left.  Now I can clearly see that I depended way too much on this person. I also had this illusion that whenever I died I could somehow take her with me. This illusion told me that AIDS was our disease and it not only belonged to me, it also belonged to her. But now it is only mine, and I am terrified.</p>

<p>So, this grief process thing is a constant flowing of day-to-day emotions. No matter what happens or who I interact with in my life, I am still one individual that belongs to me. It seems that the core issues of my feelings relate back to my own issues of grief and loss. All my grief is not just about loss of friends to AIDS or my grieving of the loss of my health, it goes back to my childhood. I have experienced many losses in life dating back to when I lost my favorite stuffed monkey.</p>

<p>If I do not allow myself to let the natural process of grief run it’s course then I will act out in ways that are not healthy. I have learned that it is a daily maintenance of recognizing my feelings, validating them, sharing with others and then releasing them. This is a constant roller-coaster for me and at times I feel like a failure.  Sometimes I think I am weak and I need to just be stronger. Then other times I think that I dwell too much on the past.,/p>

<p>It is difficult to have so many losses and still be reminded of them by a song, a smell, a voice, or anything that my trigger my memories. The most difficult thing for me to deal with on a daily basis is the constant reminder that the very thing that has taken away so many of my friends will some day take me away too. At times, I look into the mirror and see  utter terror in my eyes. At times, I see the pain having AIDS has brought me. Then I catch a glance of myself and see a growing, healing woman filled with courage and strength.</p>

<p>Last night my dearest friend Martina from San Francisco told me on the phone that a friend of ours had died on October 17. I instantly started to cry. I could see Michelle’s sweet face in my mind and remembered the wonderful conversations we had.  Today I feel very sad and miss Michelle and all the others I have been blessed to know. Tomorrow, perhaps, I will be angry, and scream. The next day who knows? It’s just a process that I am willing to take part in. Peace seems to come to me, and I at times am able to make sense of all the pain and sadness.</p>

<p>Someone once told me that to experience joy and happiness to the fullest then you must also be willing to embrace the pain and sadness. I am experiencing all these feelings, and healing is taking place in my life. I now look at grief as an opportunity to grow and evolve. But, I continue to take positive actions that will enable me to move through my days as gracefully as possible. I did not realize that committing to this process enhances the quality of my life. Quality of life is one of my main goals because the quantity of my days are not guaranteed.</p>

<p>In this issue is an article about the <a href="walk.html">AIDS Walkathon</a> at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility. Both Mary Cotter and myself went to this event and we were amazed. I want to express that this day of my life was one of the most amazing I have experienced. These women, who are faced with problems I can not relate to, are resilient and have a strength that inspires me.  I feel honored to have been able to join them  and share our pain about the ones we have loved and lost to AIDS. There was a moment in the day when all the laughter and talking stopped as someone read the names of women and children who had died from AIDS. To see these women lean on one another was a gift to me. I feel blessed for having been there and experienced this event, and will continue to dwell on that moment as is gives me strength.</p>

<p>I am proud of this month’s issue. Even though it was emotionally difficult to pull together I think Mary and I did a fine job bringing to you issues and solutions to dealing with grief. We also were thrilled that so many letters were sent for the Prisoners Perspective. We will continue to be committed to the issues of those incarcerated living with HIV/AIDS. Thank you to those people who shared personal stories with us. After all that’s what it is about, leaning on one another, because we all are voices that make one big voice that must be heard!</p>

<blockquote>
<h2><i>grief</i></h2>

<p><img src="gifs/tear.gif" hspace=5 align=left>Grief is a normal response to losing something or someone we care a lot about. The more we invest emotionally, the more intense our feelings of grief will be. It does not matter if you have lost a job, a pet, your health, a loved one, or anything you can think of. You will experience grief on many different levels, with the death of a loved one evoking the most intense feelings of grief.</p>

<p>Grieving is a process.  This process is neither good nor bad, neither right nor wrong. Usually grief is cyclic — there is often a balance between misery and relief, between sorrow and growth. Give yourself time, as there is no specific ending to this process.</p>

<h2><i>elements of grief</i></h2>

<p>The most common first response to bad news or loss is shock. The body may shut down, block out, or close itself off. People may say they feel numb, paralyzed or unfeeling. The mind, in response to a truth that cannot be tolerated, moves away. This may trigger denial because feelings are so painful we make believe that they are not real; that the loss simply hasn’t happened. </p>

<p>Soon the truth returns and so do other feelings. Feelings of despair, sadness, and loneliness may seem to engulf us. As this constant reminder of what has happened keeps coming to mind we may experience pain beyond belief. We may even experience physical pain in the chest which feels as if we’ve been stabbed in the heart.  We may then experience anger and rage. It is common to look for someone to blame, to be consumed by a sense of unfairness. We can feel angry at doctors, family, friends, God, or ourselves: “How and why did this happen?” At this point we may feel guilt as well. Thoughts such as, “If only I had...” or “I should have...” commonly accompany feelings of guilt.</p>

<p>Hopelessness seems to overwhelm us. We feel stuck in the depths of sadness and loss. We lose sight of the possibilities for the future. We lose our sense of direction. We tell ourselves that it will never be okay, that we will never get used to it.  We feel sorry for ourselves, often withdrawing from friends and loved ones.Sometimes all we can see is pain, sorrow, and loss.</p>

<p>What to do? Cry and wail! Get it out — it is a normal process. We can whimper, yell, scream, shudder, and weep some more. We can express our grief, our sadness, and our pain in whatever way we can, letting the feelings out. Some of us who are not used to showing our feelings may not show any emotion at all. We keep all the pain inside, often damaging ourselves.</p>

<p><img src="gifs/clock.gif" hspace=5 align=right>Those of us who internalize our emotions may become depressed and have trouble doing ordinary things.  It may become a major chore to get out of bed and brush our teeth. As time goes on, the pain may become so great that we may think of ending our lives. We may picture ourselves dying or committing suicide.</p>

<p>We may get angry: yelling at strangers while we are driving; shouting at cashiers or waiters and waitresses; kicking the dog; taking it out on co-workers or loved ones. Or we may rage at ourselves, behaving in self-destructive ways: overeating; drinking alcohol or using other drugs; generally abusing ourselves. In our process of grieving, most of us eventually reach a point of relief, acceptance, resolution, or reintegration. At this time, even though the pain still can be felt, we adapt sufficiently to be able to tolerate it. We are then ready to get on with our lives.</p>

<h2><i>getting stuck</i></h2>
<p>There are certain things that keep us from moving through grief. Some of us get stuck along the path toward acceptance. Instead what we are left with is continued grief that does not let up, does not subside, and does not end. This happens if we don’t acknowledge and accept the loss, if we are unwilling to let go of who or what we cared about — whether it be health, a loved one, or a career.</p>

<p>Why do we get stuck?  Some of us had painful losses early in life that we never worked through. For us, current loss taps into all of the unresolved emotions we never dealt with during earlier losses. Perhaps many losses happened in close time frames, such as more than one loved one dying in one month or being abandoned by friends, family, or a partner. So we are unable to deal with this new loss because the combined grief is too big.</p>

<p>Some of us, for many different reasons, have a difficult time coping with life. We are less able to handle stress and loss, perhaps due to our temperament or nature. Emotions get mixed up and we are unable to sort through them and make sense of them. Grief overwhelms us and upsets what was previously only a shaky balance. Another reason why many of us get stuck in grief is that we lack support systems or do not feel supported in our grief by the world.</p>

<h2><i>managing grief</i></h2>
<p>Healing is vital! We must not become stuck in denial, making believe the feelings do not exist while they eat away at us. We especially need to guard against relapsing into old behaviors such as getting drunk, doing drugs, overspending, overeating or not eating, and any other acts that abuse our bodies and our spirits. We deserve a lot of credit for allowing ourselves this natural grieving process. It takes a lot of courage to feel feelings, and it is not easy. Here are some ways to handle the kinds of feelings that may come up.</p>

<ul>
<li>Most importantly, we must learn to be patient and gentle with ourselves. We must allow the process to happen, and allow the pain to run its course. Then we can move on. This takes time! There is no formula or timetable we can depend on for guidance. People experience loss differently and need to value and validate their own process.<br><br>

<li>Having people around helps us through the grief process. This can be seen in the interactions of a support group. Being alone in our grief condemns us to be alone with our pain. For most of us, sharing the pain helps lessen the feelings for a time. Most of us will also need some time alone. <br><br>

<li>There are four phases of recovery from painful loss: learning, feeling, taking action, and accepting. It is helpful to know about the experience, to have a sense of what is happening and what we are likely to experience.<br><br>

<li>Sooner or later, we need to feel the feelings. We need to experience the fullness of the loss, the sadness, and the pain. It may be helpful to experience anger, even if  seems unreasonable. It’s important to examine it, express it, share it with someone else, and, eventually, when ready, let it go.<br><br>
  
<li>After we have experienced the depth of our feelings, it is time to act. We can talk  about the feelings we’re having, join a support group, write our feelings down (journaling), change some things about our life. Also, we can do things like going for long walks, listening to nice music, cooking a healthy meal, reading some fiction, going to a movie, or anything that involves taking positive action.<br><br>

<li>Acceptance is a goal of the grief process after experiencing losses. True acceptance means forgiving ourselves for not being the perfect parent, lover, sibling, or friend. (It means, when we are ready, letting go of our anger — at ourselves, our loved ones, and God.) Acceptance includes saying good-bye to what we have lost. It means we remember unfinished business and allow it to remain as it is. The wounds heal, the pain subsides, and we are left with the healing scars and memories. Acceptance also means lifting our heads and looking forward. It does not necessarily mean a happy ending. Time does not necessarily heal all wounds, but it helps. The painful feelings become less raw and more tolerable. Life opens up to us again, if we allow it.</ul>

<h2 align=center><i>entering the whirlwind</i></h2>
<h5 align=center>by Christopher-Dana Rose</h5>

<p align=center>We enter the whirlwind<br> 
Shaken and unsettled<br>
quite unexpectedly<br>
by all that has gone<br>
on before<br>
<br>
Aplomb in our<br> 
desire to work<br>
it through<br>
<br>
Uncertainties flailing<br>
right and left, up and down<br>
<br>
Yet, a mere promise looms<br> 
somewhere in the distance<br>
<br>
It is the largest<br>
most elusive<br>
and right<br>
now most unmentionable word in the world<br>
—healing—<br>
<br>
The winds calm<br>
<br>
With due work<br>
restoration<br>
awaits us</p>

<p align=right>For the last four years I have been doing AIDS-related bereavement at the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center (in New York City), and I must say from the very outset that this is the most important and life-affirming work I have ever done.</p>

<p align=right>Often when I tell people what I’m doing they say, “Gee, that must be very tiring work,” or “Don’t you ever get depressed from doing that work?,” or, “It must be very sad.”’</p>

<p align=right>And you know, their questions are on target as to how I feel sometimes. It’s the honest feeling that I must readily recognize. I do get tired from doing this work. Yet, there is the failure to ask the other half of the question, “Dana, do you feel good about your job?” or “What good comes from doing this work?” I am then able to deliver an answer that is powerful, hopeful and life-affirming. Doing the work of grief and loss in a “safer” setting takes us to a new place. We are moved towards healing!</p>

<p align=right>I become excited about my work, even in the middle of the tiredness. In the above poem, “Entering the Whirlwind,” I seek to let people know that to do the work is not easy. But it is what is required so that we can get on with our lives in a healthy way. “A mere promise looms somewhere in the distance.”</p>

<p align=right>Here at centerBridge, we provide a three tier service of individual counseling, support groups, trainings for staff of CBOs, hospitals and other agencies as well as doing memorials and other community events.</p>

<p align=right>Doing this work as either counselor or participant works. All of our work ends in celebration — celebration of our lives and of those who have touched our lives and have now gone on. None of us get to the healing place rapidly without work. And celebration of any kind seems far off and inappropriate. Healing does come. I know. I have had many loss experiences around the Pandemic. It pains! Yet, again I quote my poem, “The winds calm...with due work restoration awaits us.”</p>

<p align=right>I invite you to “Enter the Whirlwind” with support.</p>

<h2><i>managing grief in an AIDS organization</i></h2>
<h5>by Kitty Schoen, LCSW</h5>

<p>After more than a decade, cumulative losses have saturated the private and work lives of AIDS/HIV service providers. Consequently, grief, traditionally thought of as a personal matter, must become a concern of organizations. Many workplaces, however, are largely unprepared for coping with multiple losses and are suffering from complications associated with grief. The strategies outlined in this article suggest ways organizations can cope with chronic loss and minimize the destructive consequences of grief.</p>

<h2><i>sources of grief</i></h2>

<p>Grief and loss are not new issues, especially in human service and health care settings. Yet in AIDS organizations, a combination of factors contribute to the exceptional role of grief and its intensity. First, the exponential growth in the number of cases of HIV infection and deaths and routes of HIV transmission have resulted in the concentration of losses within families, friendship networks, and communities. Second, the high numbers of organizational staff —  and their friends — and volunteers who have AIDS/HIV is unusual among health care agencies focusing on a specific disease such as cancer or heart disease. Third, staff members often rely heavily on co-worker support to counteract the stresses of AIDS/HIV caregiving, and the illness or death of a coworker becomes a source of additional grief. All of these conditions combine to create chronic traumatic stresses, and AIDS/HIV organizations of all sizes — from large agencies to private mental health and medical practices with small staffs — are, in effect, “grieving organizations.” </p>

<p><img src="gifs/leaf.gif" hspace=5 align=left>Why have so few AIDS/HIV service organizations addressed grief-related stress? A large part of the answer lies in the cultural relationship to grief in the United States. The grieving process is poorly understood, largely invisible, and its impact minimized. There is little precedent in the workplace for addressing personal issues, especially ones as profoundly personal as grief. Some managers have feared that, if they addressed grief directly, they would be opening a Pandora’s box of uncontrollable emotions and expectations that they will provide employees support for other personal issues. They have also been concerned that grief support would require unreasonable amounts of time, money and other resources. Finally, many AIDS/HIV service organizations have been in the early stages of development and have only now been able to attend to the pressures of constant loss. </p>

<h2><i>the dynamics of loss saturation</i></h2>

<p>Organizations experience the effects of grief at all levels: among individuals, within groups, and pervasively throughout the organization. The symptoms of loss saturation in organizations closely parallel the impact of grief on individuals. Most can be attributed to the emotionally and physically draining nature of grief, the lack of acknowledgment and support for the grieving process, and feelings of helplessness, rage, and survivor guilt.</p>

<p>Responses to loss — anticipatory grief, bereavement, and trauma — are all complex experiences that change over time. Sometimes their impact is obvious, immediate, and compelling. At other times, they are like an undertow, exerting a powerful but invisible influence. A wide range of sometimes conflicting feelings are a normal part of the grieving process. They include sadness, despair, relief, loneliness, anger, elation, emptiness, guilt, meaninglessness and meaningfulness. Three concepts are particularly important in characterizing loss saturation: unresolved grief, survivor guilt, and post-traumatic stress.</p>

<p>Unresolved grief often plays a substantial and hidden role in organizational problems such as reduced productivity, low morale, increased turnover, difficulty settings limits, and inadequate attention to positive feedback and informal support. These problems become more deeply entrenched when employees believe it is unsafe or unprofessional to mention the hard-to-manage feelings associated with grief.</p>

<p>Survivor guilt is another powerful but largely invisible phenomenon. For most people, it is difficult to reconcile personal well-being with the dire circumstances others face. AIDS, because it is so serious and, in some areas, so pervasive, evokes a particularly stark contrast between those who are infected and those who are not. The urge to create a more equitable balance between the poles makes it difficult for some individuals and work groups to set limits or take adequate care of themselves, causing them, for example, to overwork. The result is a state of sympathetic “dis-ease.” It is also typical for loss-saturated organizations to focus less and less on the positive aspects of work, including positive feedback and acknowledgment, celebration of life events, and activities that nurture staff members.</p>

<p>The post-traumatic stress model is helpful in understanding another common dynamic experienced in loss-saturated work environments. According to this theory, individual reactions to trauma swing between adaptive numbing and a flooding of feelings. In the workplace, this frequently leads to tension between those at opposing ends of the spectrum and to accusations that some are “over-involved,” and others are “jaded and burned out.” This dynamic is often reflected in conflicts between new and old staff, direct and indirect service providers, and seropositive and seronegative staff, or along social divisions of gender, class and race.</p>

<h2><i>planning a response</i></h2>

<p><img src="gifs/leaf.gif" hspace=5 align=right>To respond to these pressures, organizations must create a culture that openly acknowledges the presence of grief and gives permission to staff to express a range of reactions to loss. This is most effectively accomplished through a planning process that seeks to develop ongoing and easily maintained strategies aimed at both day-to-day operations and formal structures, policies, and benefits.</p>

<p>The main hurdle to achieving these goals is gaining recognition that grief-related issues are appropriate and important for an organization to address. Once this is accomplished, a straightforward planning process in itself an intervention, since it acts as a formal acknowledgment that grief has an impact on work, can be employed to develop strategies tailored to the specific needs of the work site. The success of the planning process depends on two conditions. First, it is important to have input from the entire staff, and in some agencies, volunteers. The involvement of staff members counteracts their feelings of helplessness, a common effect of loss saturation. Second, since organizational strategies may include the revision of policies and benefits, and changes in the workplace as a whole, management support is crucial.</p>

<p>An assessment is the first step of the planning process. The assessment seeks to define the problem; identify confounding organizational issues such as changes in structure; begin to clarify staff expectations of the organization; and provide baseline data for evaluation purposes. In defining the problem, it is helpful to note trends related to demographics, departments, or job classifications. For example, direct service providers may be particularly vulnerable to distress, or there may be departments where staff — responding to personal or workplace losses — may be more subject to loss saturation.</p>

<p>Developing a training program, the second step, can lay the groundwork for understanding and discussing grief in the workplace. The primary objective of training is to impact an appreciation of the range of “normal” responses to loss and experiences of grief, and to explain why people react differently. Sometimes it is helpful to offer training to supervisors first because of their central role in creating a supportive environment. Ultimately, an all-staff training is necessary, because it serves as a collective acknowledgment of loss and creates a common framework for discussion and strategy development.</p>

<h2><i>strategies for addressing grief</i></h2>

<p>The training process sets the stage for developing strategies in four categories: identifying ongoing ways to acknowledge losses; providing support for a range of grieving experiences and needs; making changes in policies and benefits; and creating mechanisms to acknowledge appreciation of staff. Strategies need to address all levels of the organization and should take place in many arenas, including during all-staff meetings, within individual departments, and through committees of staff representatives.</p>

<p><b>Acknowledge Loss</b>. The ongoing acknowledgment of loss reminds staff that there are external sources of psychological distress and minimizes the tendency of staff to blame themselves, others, or the organization for this distress. The first step in this process is for supervisors to convey the news of a loss sensitively, consistently, and confidentially to all appropriate staff. In one agency, the personnel director developed a folded note card to distribute when an employee had died or wished to disclose a disabling illness or personal loss. Other direct service groups have used paper hearts with patient names to notify staff of deaths of clients; “change boards” to show not only deaths, but also all major changes in client status; and staff journals, scrap books, and periodic memorials. Employers can incorporate into staff meetings, case conferences, or team building sessions, designated times for discussing the impact of loss on staff.</p>

<p><b>Provide Support</b>. Support strategies seek to create opportunities for “debriefing,” that is, expressing emotions associated with loss and illness. Different coping styles require different support strategies. While informal support may occur spontaneously among employees, especially when loss is frequently acknowledged in the workplace, many employers will have to develop more formal strategies.</p>

<p>Support groups are useful when carefully facilitated and focused on the content of work and its relation to grief, and not on other organizational issues. They must also allow for various styles of participation. When only a portion of the staff is involved in support groups, the workplace may become divided between those attending and those not attending. A monthly “team building” session, including all staff members, is an effective alternative to a support group. Some work sites offer a paid hour off each week for staff to pursue their own forms of support—ranging from individual therapy and 12-step programs to exercise routines. Others sponsor on-site stress management, grief support, and relaxation programs to meet a range of staff interests and needs.</p>

<p><b>Assess Personnel Policies and Benefits</b>. Changes in personnel policies and benefits are important not only for their tangible outcomes, but also because they incorporate an employer’s acknowledgment of grief into the culture of the workplace. This commitment helps sustain the changes initiated by the planning process.</p>

<p>Design specific personnel policies to offer support and to accommodate the acute and chronic stresses of grief. Redefine bereavement leave and dependent care leave policies to be inclusive of non-traditional family members and friends, or to be used at the discretion of employees. “Planned sick leave” or “mental health days” give staff an opportunity to take time off when feeling overwhelmed, and allow employers time to plan for staffing. “Flex time” not only helps grieving employees adjust their work schedules, but also gives them more control over the conditions of work, a critical factor in minimizing burnout.</p>

<p><b>Formalize Staff Appreciation</b>. Individuals and organizations need to balance the constant strain of loss by deliberately creating opportunities for positive interactions among staff. Identifying times for staff members to come together informally during lunches and outings, for instance, helps build trust and good will. Staff also need regular opportunities to talk about their accomplishments and goals and to receive feedback from supervisors and coworkers. Without such efforts, the interpersonal life of an organization can become bleak.</p>

<p>Once it is developed, distribute a description of grief-related strategies to new staff during orientation and to old staff at yearly personnel reviews. Continually evaluate the strategies, first at three to four months after implementation, and then at regular intervals, either semi-annually or yearly. Periodic evaluations help sustain grief interventions and adjust them to changing needs of staff members and the organization.</p>

<h2><i>conclusion</i></h2>
<p><img src="gifs/leaf.gif" hspace=5 align=left>It may be surprising that such a simple approach can really help organizations cope with grief and loss. While this process cannot change the magnitude of grief within AIDS organizations, acknowledgment of loss and support of employees makes the difference between a well-functioning organization and one diminished in effectiveness. By bringing difficult feelings into the open and implementing concrete solutions, employers and staff can understand the appropriate place of grief in AIDS work and get beyond the barriers of unacknowledged emotion.</p>

<title>PWAC: coping after a lover's death</title>

<hr size=6 align=center width=50% noshade>

<h2 align=center><i>coping after a lover’s death</i></h2>

<h5 align=center>by Stephen McFadden, CSW, ACSW</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You finally did it — after your own struggle with coming out, first to yourself and then to the world, perhaps after dates and involvements with all the wrong people (in all the wrong places) — you have fallen in love! And s/he loves you back!</p>

<p>You set up house (or co-op or condo). You build a life. To friends who knew you as Sheila or Jim, you know become Sheila-and-Joyce or Jim-and-Frank. You even introduce your lover (you just love using that word!) to your family and co-workers, something you never dreamed would happen when you were 19 and feeling like the only gay person in the universe.</p>

<p>It’s a great feeling. And when the relationship grows and lasts, and months turn into years, the initial heady feeling of being “in love” settles into a comfortable familiarity, with private jokes about mundane things and a shared intimacy. Of course there are tough times and struggles. But as time goes on, you know that this is your life partner. And for lesbians and gay men, this can be doubly wonderful because it represents our right and ability to love fully and deeply, in spite of overwhelming odds.</p>

<p>And then...the bottom of your world drops out. Your lover dies. And the partner who confirmed your identity as a person able to love is no longer there. And you wonder, what in the world do I do now?</p>

<h2><i>special meanings</i></h2>

<p><img src="gifs/wheat.gif" hspace=5 align=left>Every research study  done on stress has consistently reported the death of a close relative, especially a spouse, as the most stressful passage in life. This is true for straight as well as gay people. Yet although our mourning is similar, it is also different in some significant ways.</p>

<p>First, as I pointed out above, joining your life with a lover is a developmental step for may lesbians and gay men. It confirms our ability to love. And love is a many-splendored thing when you grow up thinking it is wrong or will never happen. Unlike our straight brothers and sisters, when we present our lovers and our shared lives together to the world, it is an act of coming out, of pride, of identity. This is as true when we appear as a couple to the supermarket check-out person as it is when we visit Aunt Harriet or Uncle Ted.</p>

<p>For lesbians and gay men who are not out to family or to coworkers, this loss can be especially hard because it is not fully shared. Expression of sympathy and respect for your need to mourn are not forthcoming. This silence is difficult because it doesn’t acknowledge that the center of your life is missing. </p>

<p>To lose a spouse is an enormous loss for anyone. But for lesbians and gay men, this loss also entails the loss of a built identity, for ourselves as individuals and as part of a lesbian or gay couple.</p>

<h2><i>lack of recognition</i></h2>

<p>For lesbians and gay men who are not out to family or to coworkers, this loss can be especially hard because it is not fully shared. Expressions of sympathy and respect for your need to mourn are not forthcoming. This silence is difficult because it doesn’t acknowledge that the center of your life is missing.</p>

<p>All too often, those who are out in the world become aware that the straight community doesn’t acknowledge or recognize the full importance of the loss. This can be reflected in practical matters, such as the company’s bereavement leave policies, or in personal ways, such as silence from extended family or an expectation that you should be “moving on” more quickly. </p>

<p>Partly, this reflects society’s general discomfort with death. But it also reflects homophobia. This can be direct, as painfully demonstrated in the scene from Torch Song Trilogy when Harvey Fierstein’s mother is angered at his equating the loss of his partner with the loss of her husband. Or it can be subtle, as when co-workers don’t know “what to say,” or when they casually and thoughtlessly talk about their marriages in a way that would be more sensitive and thoughtful with a straight widow or widower.</p>

<h2><i>our own rituals</i></h2>

<p>One outcome of the AIDS crisis has been an awareness of the need for rituals to mourn our losses. Whereas the concept of a memorial service is not new, many AIDS memorials have become highly personal (sometimes theatrical, sometimes political) in ways far removed from traditional observances. Paradoxically, AIDS memorials often came about due to the need to have a ritual for the deceased’s gay family apart from the straight family. Invariably, these memorials have emphasized the person’s gayness, loving relationships with members of the same-sex, and connection with a community.</p>

<p><img src="gifs/wheat.gif" align=right hspace=5 alt=" ">These rituals should not be limited to AIDS. There indeed is a need to remember and celebrate the struggle to develop a gay/lesbian identity, and the loving connections that come with this. Lovers, ex-lovers and friends can share and remember. When there is no specific ritual to enact this, it is important to do it privately with those who knew the deceased.</p>

<h2><i>the initial shock</i></h2>

<p>Nothing quite prepares you for the sudden realization that your lover is no longer physically in the world. Even when there has been a preparation for the death, as with AIDS and other terminal illnesses, you can’t really know what it is like until it happens.</p>

<p>Some people feel tremendous grief and sorrow. Others feel nothing at first. It is very important not to judge your immediate reaction as your full response to the loss, because bereavement is a process rather than an event. One common feeling is dissociation, a feeling of not being in the real world. You have literally lost a part of yourself, the part that joined with your lover as a unit. The experience is akin to having an amputation. Actually, the business side of death (attending to funerals, notifying friends and family, dealing with estates) provides a focus for the grieving person. Many people are amazed at the survivor’s ability to attend to these matters. It makes sense when you realize that this is a way of still caring for and about the lover who died.</p>

<h2><i>feelings</i></h2>

<p>A whole host of feelings gradually emerges. Although many experts identify stages of mourning, my experience has been that the varied emotions come up differently for different people. Depression and sadness over the loss is universal, but for some it is a constant feeling, while for others it is intermittent. Numbness and dissociation occur frequently as well. There can be a sense of living in two worlds, the everyday world that goes on and your own private world of grief.</p>

<p>You can also feel angry, angry at your lover for leaving you, angry at the world for not caring enough, and specifically angry over AIDS and homophobia. The anger may be clear and direct, or it can come out irrationally at other people’s preoccupation with unimportant things.</p>

<p>None of these feelings is wrong. They are all reactions to the loss. And you are not going crazy when they come up all at once or at different times. If the depression deepens, causing more serious dysfunction, you should consider seeing a therapist or possibly a psychiatrist who may prescribe antidepressant medication. But depression and reduced functions are normative after a death, and don’t usually lift after the first few weeks.</p>

<h2><i>holding on versus moving on</i></h2>

<p>You will get repeated messages from concerned friends and family to “move on.” Don’t. My experience is that it’s very appropriate to have a period of time where you “hold onto” the person who’s died. Some people “talk” to their lovers when they’re alone and missing them. Others have dreams where the lover is still alive. It’s important to give special emphasis to things that remind you of your lover. One client of mine prepared a special dish that his lover had made every Thanksgiving. Another played his lover’s favorite CD repeatedly before going to sleep. Although these rituals evoke pain, they also value the person who has died, and focus on his or her life rather than only on death and loss.</p>

<h2>the role of support</i></h2>

<p>Likewise, it is important to give yourself as much time as you need to talk about your lover with your friends and with those who knew him or her. This meets a need not only for you but for the others left behind as well. </p>

<p>Sadly, you will find that some friends will not be able to join with you in this. They may be uncomfortable with death or with your need to remember. They also will be moving on sooner than you will, which can be painful because it leaves you feeling more alone than ever.</p>

<p>It can be helpful to reach out to other people who have also lost important people in their lives. They often can be the most understanding. This is why bereavement groups have been so helpful, especially around AIDS. Many gay community, social service and religious groups sponsor bereavement programs. If a group is not gay or lesbian-specific, find out if it is gay-sensitive.</p>

<h2><i>time</i></h2>

<p>Although it is a small comfort at the moment of loss, the old dictum that the passage of time causes the loss to be less intense is true. <img src="gifs/clock.gif" hsapce=5 align=left alt=" ">But it is usually a much longer period of time than expected. And you never completely forget the lover, nor should you. Your love was a reflection of growth and development for each of you as individuals and as a couple. If you loved together, you overcame homophobia and fear to do that. So the loss will be felt periodically — as at anniversaries — and also unexpectedly. It is tempered but not eliminated by the knowledge that if you have loved, you have also allowed your lover to become a part of yourself. That blended part should continue to value yourself as a full person with the human right to have genuine and caring love in your life.</p>

<title>PWAC: grieving in the desert</title>

<h2 align=center><i>grieving in the desert</i></h2>
<h5 align=center>by Luis L&oacute;pez Detr&eacute;s</h5>

<p>From August 24 to 27, the National Minority AIDS Council (NMAC) held a Conference called National People of Color Living with HIV Leadership Forum.  The forum was designed in the form of a spiritual retreat and took place in the desert of Paulden, Arizona.</p>

<p>This leadership forum was designed for and by existing and emerging leaders who are HIV positive or living with AIDS, in a relaxing and enjoyable environment designed to inspire and connect the participants with the elements.  As NMAC promised, it was “a place to stop and get away from the ‘rat race,’ to re-energize and recommit to yourself, to your friends, to your family and to your community.”</p>

<p>In this forum there were approximately 40 to 50 people from different parts of the United States and most of them had decided to relax spiritually for the whole weekend.</p>

<p>In this respect, I have to say that the conference succeeded in making us reevaluate what we are doing, and whether we want to continue working in this field.  If so, what can we do differently not just in terms of other people living with AIDS/HIV, but also ourselves?</p>

<p> I was personally going through a period of depression and grieving due to a recent breakup.  In fact,  I’m still grieving.  The desert forced me to think, meditate and develop better tools for grieving and healing.  I could not run away or go on denying my own personal wounds and broken heart, as usually happens in the city.  Even when we grieve in the city we do it at a slower pace due to the stress, distractions, shallowness and denial of the mundane daily life in the city.  This just prolongs our pain, increases our stress and makes our lives not worth living.  We need to grieve honestly before we can let go, and go on.</p>

<p>Before I went to the desert I never understood why even the Bible alludes so much to the desert.  The powerful experience of being in the infinite, beautiful, quiet and secluded desert provided me with much thought about organizing and understanding myself, and getting new purpose in life.  It made me feel like a monk.  I have to admit I was first afraid of rattlesnakes, but thank God none crossed my path.  There were other kinds of snakes I needed to get rid of, and anyway I have encountered many more snakes and scorpions back in the city.  I have had trouble recognizing them, especially the poisonous ones.</p>

<p>On the morning of August 25, I walked with a group of people to a mountaintop.  There we found the remains of an old native Indian sanctuary.  I prepared myself by wearing a Native American earring and holding a stick in hand for the journey.  I also wore a medicine bag around my neck, which was a gift to all of us from the facilities where we were staying.  Everybody got a different rock inside with a particular emblem to invoke.  I believe that people have a path to follow, so I think I got the rock I was supposed to.  I got the Wolf, which means, “prey is usually old or sick.  Keeps a species strong by eliminating the weak.  Invoke Wolf to help us eliminate our own weaknesses and non-productive thoughts that weaken the spirit.”  I thought this was a very appropriate rock for me and just having it helped me overcome some thoughts.</p>

<p>Once in the sanctuary, one of the guys had a crystal rock and was burning sage for cleaning.  The majesty of the desert made me get involved, and even when I did not believe in this kind of practice, the need for healing and rituals made me ask him to borrow it to clean and obtain healing for myself.  There is something about the desert that, even being physically alone, you feel the presence of something you can’t see, but that makes you feel comfortable and connected with yourself.  At least this was my experience.  I thought a lot about how much easier it would probably have been to be HIV negative, that maybe my relationship would not have ended, that it would have been different and constructive if I just had been negative.  But later on I was relieved, I felt strong and able to handle things, as painful as they might be.</p>

<p>That afternoon I and my friends Carlos, Moisés, and Jesús decided to go on an adventure to explore Sedona.  This place is well known for its Red Rock mountain formations and as a magnetic center where all energies re-encounter.  You get this vision of how old the world is, how things come and go while these mountains remain and the panorama absorbs you in many thoughts about your own vulnerability, especially if you have AIDS/HIV and are hurting.</p>

<p>On Sunday August 27, Carlos, Moisés, Jesús and I hit the road once again, this time on our way to the Grand Canyon.  Once in the area we went to the Sony Imax to see a movie about this place.  The theatre and the movie were breathtaking.  I even wondered if it was necessary to go and see for ourselves since the movie seemed to be enough.   Anyway we decided to proceed and see with our own eyes what the greatness of this Grand Canyon was all about.</p>

<p>In my life I never experienced what I experienced flying in a plane over the Grand Canyon.  My life has been changed forever.  I felt compelled by the majesty of this amazing place.  I felt I belonged in the Grand Canyon mystery.  I did not know if I should cry, laugh or just die.  After this experience I understood that life is worth living for moments like this, in spite of all the suffering and agony we go through.  There must be other places I should see before dying, but dying at that moment was perfectly OK.  I understood I have been afraid of dying of AIDS, because AIDS is unpredictable.  Even when you are certain that you will die from it, you just don’t know when or how.  But the Grand Canyon will be there after me, as it has been before.  Somehow this comforted me.</p>

<p>It was hard for my friends Carlos and Moisés to understand why at times during the weekend I was absorbed and quiet and not laughing or paying attention to some of their jokes.  They knew I was grieving but they wanted me to be there with them.  And truly, I was there, but I could not be in denial of my wounds.  I had a hemorrhage in my heart and my soul, and I was taking care of putting in some stitches to help me let go and go on.  It is still to see if the scars of such grief will live on.</p>
       
<p>Many thoughts came to my mind like: Nobody can fill anybody’s needs, neither to be happy nor help anybody to be happy if you are not willing to give and absorb happiness and understand your own weaknesses and insecurities.  I understood how much I have to give to everybody and what a disservice people do to themselves when they run away from me because I am HIV positive.  And it is not like I can’t say that there is nothing wrong with me.  But is it better to be with someone negative just because they are negative?  Does that enhance and make relationships longer and fulfilling?  Is being HIV negative the promise of a long healthy happy life?  I think I deserve to love and to be loved, and I am worth a chance. </p?

<p>A nice guy who was at the conference and works for GMHC wrote me a card to help me deal with what I was going through:  </p>

<p><i>Always make time for <br>
you to love you.  Take <br>
the time to discover the <br>
beautiful man inside that <br>
the rest of the world sees.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>He also put this poem in the card:</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>Relationship <font size=-1><i>by Sandra Sanyiki Chapman</i></font></h3>

<p><i>I need to be with me now.<br>
I need to let myself love me deeply,<br>
Care for me tenderly,<br>
Help me carefully.<br>
I need to take me in my arms,<br>
Rock myself into a deep sleep, <br>
and rest until my spirit rises<br>
renewed and willed for a work<br>
long overdue. </i></p></blockquote>

<p>Thinking back over this weekend, I can’t say I had a great time as a boy who went dancing.  Healing is a process that requires thinking and meditating on painful thoughts.  It requires us to recognize that we are suffering.  Somehow being in the desert helps you clear your thoughts and dissipate some of the pain.  It reminds me of stories in the Bible about the desert — the desert, a place where even in the presence of my troubled loneliness, I never felt lonely.</p>

<p>Then I woke up to reality in the city and I had a thought,  “Am I going to die soon?  Am I going to let this broken heart bleed to death?”  “No,” I answered myself.  “I’m not dying yet, I still have work to do.  And I will love again ... someday.”</p>

<h3 align=center>thoughts on the contradictions of living with HIV and AIDS</h3>
<h5 align=center>by Kyle Beard</h5>

<p>This month the editors of <i>Newsline</i> suggested that the focus of my article should tie in with the central theme of this month’s magazine and, as you probably have figured out by now, that theme is grief and bereavement. Frankly, I would prefer to write about the fashion scene in Paris or about sure-fire pick-up lines, but, being the responsible and obedient writer that I am, I am following their request.</p>

<p>Yeah, sure, I have lost a lot of friends to AIDS and I know that I am about to lose another one very soon, but I still don’t really know how I feel about it all, nor am I at all clear about how I handle death. Some are a lot harder than others and some take longer to get over, but the fact is that all of them have a very profound effect; none of them are ignored or passed over. Naturally, the deaths of very close friends are the hardest to take and harder to get over but news of any AIDS death is difficult. Well, that’s not really true. I would be overjoyed to hear of death from AIDS for Newt Gingrich or Jesse Helms.</p>

<p>The death of my friend Robert in April was especially difficult to deal with, but, as with many AIDS deaths it was also sort of a blessing. He had been sick for about six months and had spent almost that entire time in a hospital. Moreover, not only was he in the hospital, because of the fact that his white blood-cells were completely destroyed, he had to spend most of that time in isolation. However, that wasn’t all.</p>

<p>He was also forced to go through every stupid, and perhaps unnecessary, test the doctors could dream up. This went on until Robert refused any further tests and all medications. He didn’t die right away, but at least he felt that he had some control over his fate.</p>

<p>Another factor which confused my feelings about Robert’s death was concern for our mutual friend John. John and Robert were very close and since all of Robert’s family were in California, and also because Robert trusted John, he became Robert’s caretaker during those torturous final months. John also has AIDS and while his health is quite good, like all of us he needs to watch out for himself. He was just terrific in visiting Robert and seeing that he was comfortable and had whatever he needed. No one could have ever asked for a better friend. However, as the months went by I began to see the effect all of this was having on John. He remained healthy, but you could just see that he was running on empty. He was carrying an extremely heavy dual burden: his best friend was dying and he was dealing with the very difficult task of being a caregiver. Toward the end my concern began to shift from Robert to John. Thank goodness he came through it with his health intact, but I was worried.</p>

<p>John was able to handle Robert’s passing pretty well. I know he thinks of Robert a lot, but he is dealing with it all. John arranged for a lovely memorial service and I’m sure that helped him with closure. I had a rather hard time at the memorial. I thought I had adjusted to the fact that Robert was gone, but when I saw his picture I experienced the whole gamut of emotions all over again. I resolved then and there to never again attend a memorial service or funeral. Of course, I know that I will not be able to keep that promise to myself. I think I decided that because somewhere in the back of my feeble mind I must have been thinking that death is easier to deal with if one doesn’t see it. If you don’t actually see death, then it doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>But anyone with AIDS will tell you that it is not death that actually scares us, it is the realization that the next death could, and might well be, our own. This doesn’t mean that we are any less upset about our loss, but, face it, we are dealing with our own mortality every day. Now I don’t want to hear that every living person is aware that they will die; I’m sick to death of that bullshit! The abstract notion of a healthy person that they might walk out their door and be hit by a car is just not the same as it is for someone living with advanced AIDS. Our deaths are not some remote possibility - they are an inevitability! For us the idea is not if; the question is when and how! And I truly think that the fear of how we will die is our biggest nightmare.</p>

<p>From the calls I get on the PWAC NY hotline that deal with death the fear I most often hear concerns how death will come and how long will it take. I get really ticked off at movies and plays that depict death from AIDS as being some Cinderella type thing in which the person simply lies down and drifts off to sleep. Honey, if that were true, you would see a lot more open caskets at funerals. Let’s face it, this is an ugly way to die. We don’t leave beautiful corpses behind. (If you don’t believe me, just think about Rock Hudson.) The people who call the hotline know this and they are worried. Of course you get calls from people who have 800 T-cells and the tendency is to dismiss them and tell them that they have years and years to live and that they should just get on with their lives, but that would be wrong. Regardless of the number of T-cells a person does or does not have, they share the common (and justified) worry about what their death will be like. They want to know when they can expect to begin getting sick; how long they will be sick; whether they will get dementia; and how long it will take to die.</p>

<p>Then there are the PWAs who have been through a lot of illnesses and infections and they only wonder why they are forced to continue living. I recently received a very moving letter from a PWA named James who lives in Florida. I want to share some of that letter with you. </p>

<blockquote><p><i>I want to thank you for your article in the September 95 issue of Newsline. Now I know I’m not the only one who has felt everything you have felt, the exhaustion, the loneliness (and I have a lover), and especially the feeling of being damned tired. Some mornings I wake up and wonder, why another day? Why didn’t I go in my sleep? Another day of physical and emotional pain. Another day of not being able to function as I once did. Another day of watching both my weight and appetite drop. Who needs it!!! I’m a Christian and I believe in a better life after this one. I’m secure in knowing where I’m going after this so why the hell can’t I just go? Watching the pain in my lover’s eyes every time some new illness strikes, and knowing he is wondering how much time we have together. Watching him patiently trying to explain something very simple that I can’t understand because my brain doesn’t function normally anymore. Knowing that there are aspects of his work and life that I can’t share with him any longer because I just can’t understand. Having to sleep in a hospital bed in another room because I am afraid of keeping him awake with my hacking and night sweats. Then when I am feeling better and can share a bed with him, the fact that I wake up in the middle of the night in a panic confused about where I am and crying uncontrollably. It’s bad enough that I have to suffer from AIDS, but why do I have to drag another person down with me, and that’s just how I feel, that I’m a total drag on everybody.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>I’m sure you found James’ story as hard to read as I did, but it must have been even harder to write.</p>

<p>About three months ago we had a call from a brother of a PWA who was seriously ill and about to die. I did not take the initial call, but I did answer the follow-up call a few days later. The story was that this man knew that his brother was dying and that he was in a lot of pain and just wanted to die. It was obviously a close relationship and the wishes of the PWA were paramount in the mind of the brother who was calling. Basically the brother wanted help in deciding to pull the plug on the PWA. The doctors had told him there was no chance of recovery and that the PWA was in great pain. After what I understand was a very long and emotional conversation the brother reached the decision to stop all life-sustaining operations and let his brother pass. A few days later, I answered the phone and it was the brother calling to thank us for helping him decide what to do. After the life support was stopped, the PWA passed two days later with all of his family at his side. The brother was upset but he knew that he would have been more upset watching his brother linger and die inch by inch over an extended period of time. The grief was real for this family but the knowledge that they had done what was best for the PWA helped to ease their pain somewhat. The sad part of this episode for me is the knowledge that the operator who initially took the call passed away a month ago. With AIDS death just seems to follow death.</p>
<p>I think that death and bereavement are especially hard for PWAs because we are both the survivors and the dying. How do you deal with death when you are fighting for your own life? How do people stop and take time to grieve for the departed when they are worrying about whether or not they will be next? I think, and several of my friends who are doing well agree, that you handle death by living! You do everything you can possibly do to see to it that your life is fulfilling and you don’t sit around waiting for the Grim Reaper. I tell you one thing, when death comes knocking on my door, I don’t plan on being home. Let the son-of-a-bitch come looking for me! I know that not everyone is as stubborn or arrogant as I am, but damn it, what’s the alternative? As the painter Claude Monet once said, “Nothing worth having comes easy.” Living isn’t easy for anyone, but as we learned from the experiences of James and Robert, death is not easy either.</p>

<p>I still don’t know how I feel about death, and after writing this I am still confused. I am a Catholic and I think some sort of spiritual feelings do help. I have also studied a little Hinduism and Buddhism and I have come to believe that this life that we know now is only a stepping-stone to an even greater life. I don’t believe in hell (except for Helms and Gingrich, and maybe Ronald Reagen, and oh yeah, Nancy). I also firmly believe that AIDS is not some sort of punishment. It is just a disease stupid! I truly believe that what affects or determines our fate in the next life is how we deal with life right now. I don’t know if I am right, but these beliefs help me a lot.</p>

<p>I also strongly believe that, if at all possible, we have to reach out and help other people. It doesn’t matter how insignificant you might think your help might be, every time we reach out to others we are actually helping ourselves. At PWAC NY, we volunteers know a lot of people who have died and are dying. However, by continuing to do our work we honor the memory of those who have died and we help the living. Hopefully, when we pass on there will be other volunteers to take our place and keep our work and memory alive. I firmly beleive that without my work, I would be dead already. As many of you know I did try to take my own life last year and I know now that one of the reasons I tried it was because I was far too concerned about myself and oblivious to all the pain that others were going through. Now I hope that my writing, hotline work, tutoring and trying to be as good a friend as John was will help others and that my battles will help to make someone else’s battle a little easier. My godmother thinks that my being at PWAC NY hurts my health, and maybe it does a little, but I don’t think God wants or expects us to turn our backs on things that are difficult or unpleasant. And I guess that includes death. Maybe the idea is that by learning to deal with death we learn to deal with life, or vice versa. I don’t know. Does this article make any sense?</p>

<p>By the way, I got a letter from James the other day and he sounded much better. It seems that having someone to write to helps him. He is actually looking for a pen-pal in the central Florida area. If you are interested, please write to me at PWAC NY and I will forward your letter. Actually, I am starting a pen-pal service at PWAC NY. If you would like to be paired off with someone just write to me and tell me what you are looking for and I will try to match you up. Now, this is not a dating service, but if a wedding happens — MAZEL TOV!</p>

<p>Just a quick personal note here. Other than the fact that I just got over a bout of thrush in the esophagus and some of the worst fatigue I have ever experienced, I am having an anniversary. It has been three years, this November, that my T-cells have been below fifty. Not bad for an old queen! I think I’ll go to Paris and cover the spring fashions for Chanel. AU REVOIR MES PETITES!</p>

<title>PWAC: sounding off</title>

<p><font size=-1><i>Ed. The following story is a graphic, albeit, in our opinion, on-target and necessary polemic about sex and PWAs. While we never have intentions to offend, more importantly, we exist to preserve the right of PWAs to speak our minds about topics that matter to us. So while some of you may find the following dialogue disagreeable, please keep in mind that the voices of all people living with AIDS have a right to be heard, and that sex and sexuality are a part of our lives, no matter what some people would like to believe or to enforce. Besides, we wanted to make sure that you’re paying attention.</i></font></p>

<h3 align=center>Dirty Talk</h3>
<h5 align=center>by Paul Walker</h5>

<dd>Max and Bob were sitting at their favorite Chelsea gay bar one evening, drinking their second martinis.  Because they were both taking antiviral medications, they had agreed to a three-drink apiece limit once a month.  This seemed therapeutic to them both.

<dd>“It’s not a question of sex clubs or responsibility or education,” said Max.  “What we really want is to turn back the clock to the days of carefree, casual sex.  I want to be a slut again.”

<dd>“You’re too old and ugly to be a slut,” Bob said.  “You’re blind without your bifocals and your dentures flap in a mild breeze.”

<dd>“I love your splotchy bald head and those cute tufts of hair sprouting from your ears.”

<dd> “Just tell yourself, ‘No more sex.’”<dd>

 “Easy for you to say.  With your crypto you can’t have sex without crapping all over your partner.”<dd>

“You’re still ruled by your dick, and your dick will always want more.”<dd>

Max took Bob’s arm.  “Do you see that man over there in the corner?”<dd>

“That child?”<dd>
“I had sex with him last week.”<dd>
“Is he blind?  Where’d you meet him?<dd>
“At the movies.  You know.”<dd>
“Yeah, sure.  Over on, yeah.”<dd>
“Yeah.”<dd>
“Slut.”<dd>
“Will you please cram the slut stuff?  PWHIV’s — “<dd>
“Oh God.”<dd>
“PWHIV’s are entitled to sex lives, Bob.”  Max grew suddenly serious.<dd>
“Responsible sex lives with informed partners, Max.”  Bob could be serious too.  “It’s not like having sex when you were negative and could lie about everything.”<dd>
Max finished his martini and sulked.<dd>
Bob sneaked another glance at the young man across the bar.  “So how was it?  Safe sex and all?”<dd>
Max pursed his lips.  “Bartender, darling, two more here.”<dd>
“Max, my oldest, dearest and only still living friend, please tell me you used a rubber.”<dd>
“Rubbers don’t feel as good as the real thing and I’m tired of pretending that they do.”<dd>
“Max.”<dd>
“They reduce my pleasure.”<dd>
“Why not use a burlap bag?”<dd>
“Bob.”<dd>
“Then you could pull the rubber over your head.”<dd>
“You’re a skinny old prude who hasn’t had sex in centuries.  You don’t understand.”<dd>

Bob took his friend’s hand.  “I understand, sweetheart.  I just don’t sympathize.”<dd>
They sipped from their fresh drinks.  Bob ate his olive.<dd>
“You know,” Max whispered, “he swallowed my cum, that boy did.”<dd>
“No.  No.”<dd>
“I used all my body language to tell him not to.”<dd>
“Did you use your mouth?  Why didn’t you just tell him you have AIDS?”<dd>
“I do not have AIDS!  I’m HIV positive asymptomatic.  I have hundreds of T-cells.”<dd>
“Tell that to the kid.”<dd>
“The kid is an adult who is responsible for his own actions and well-being.  And if he is negative, what’s he doing going down on people at the movies?  He said he wanted me to give it to him.  He spit it all out right away.  People say swallowing won’t infect you because saliva kills the virus, so what’s the problem?”<dd>
Bob rested his face in one hand.  “Are we really going to have this conversation again?  God, every five years.”<dd>
Max began.  “No one’s jumping up and down about straight PWA’s having public sex.  Jesse Helms isn’t demanding that infected hemophiliacs give it all up.  Only the gays, the dirty, nasty perverts.  We asked for it.  Oh yes.  Please, please give me a terminal disease so that I can live on disability and welfare and never have sex again.  No one told Jesse he couldn’t have bypass surgery because he chose to eat crap food and smoke tobacco all his life, did they!  Don’t you look at me like that, Bob.  That young man was the first sex I’ve had in months.  Double digit months.  And he propositioned me.  All the other men I meet are negative.  Every single one of them.  And they’re fussy fussy fussy, like their asses are lined with gold and their dicks shoot vodka tonics.  It’s a fucking limited world I live in, Bob, and it gets smaller every year.  So don’t you judge me.”<dd>
“If we won’t judge ourselves, who will?” Bob asked.<dd>
“I don’t know.  What will it matter in a hundred years?  Most things don’t matter after twenty minutes.”<dd>
“The religious right could judge us.” <dd>
“Oh let he who is without sin.”<dd>
“Or the Republicans or the Christian Coalition — “<dd>
“Oh shut up shut up.”<dd>
“Or the Catholics or the health departments or the FDA or the CDC.  We’ll just pretend that you couldn’t be arrested in several states for that kind of behavior.”<dd>
“It’s not a crime to be HIV positive,” Max insisted.<dd>
“But why isn’t it a crime to be careless and stupid?”<dd>
Long sips of fragrant gin, until Max said, “Poor Bob.  When was the last time you got laid?”<dd>
“1981.”<dd>
“God. Really? Was it good?”<dd>
“Fabulous. Me and Rock Hudson on a beach on Catalina Island.”<dd>
“I’m not so sure I believe that.”<dd>
“You have to have faith.”<dd>
They drank a little more, contemplating past sexual encounters and dimly remembered faces.<dd>
“Damn,” Bob said, “I forgot my Welbutrin.”<dd>
“I have Prozac.”<dd>
“I hate Prozac.  It’s so gauche.  Got any Ativan?”<dd>
“Too weak.”<dd>
“Yeah.”<dd>
They sighed.<dd>
“Max,” said Bob, “sweetheart, angel love.  Are you going to eat that olive?”<dd>
“No, honey.  Take it.”<dd>
Bob did and ordered two more drinks, which was past their limit.<dd>

<title>PWAC: a very strong thing to feel</title>

<p><img src="gifs/darkorch.gif" width=550 height=8></p>
<h2 align=center>The Third Annual ACE Walkathon at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility</h2>

<p align=right><font size=-1><i>On September 9, 1995, at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison for women in upstate New York, the ACE (AIDS Counseling and Education) program held its third annual AIDS Walkathon. Over 250 participants marched, including inmates, staff and civilians. The previous year the Walkathon raised over $4,000, with proceeds benefiting the ACE program itself as well as other outside organizations. This year’s Walkathon will benefit the Incarnation Children’s Center, a home-like residence for infants and young children living with AIDS, the IPC/Bedford Hills Infirmary, and the ACE Program.<br>
</i>Newsline <i>was invited to attend the event, and we decided to share our impressions as well as to ask the Walkathon participants what the day meant to them.<br>
After passing through the long security process, we made our way into the compound. Walking along the paths that lead us up to the grounds where the Walkathon would be held, our escort pointed out a section of a building that was fenced off from the attached structures. “Death Row,” she said, and we were then informed that in the weeks since New York state had passed the death penalty, a death row was planned and built at exactly the same time as women living with AIDS were planning this Walkathon. The irony was almost unbearable.<br>

The Walkathon was set inside a large yard, surrounded by buildings that house the women as well as the ACE office. Circling the yard was a high fence, decorated with quilts, ribbons and other materials the women had used to express their dedication to the cause and their grief for those who had died.<br>

Walkathon participants, many bearing numbered placards decorated with the names of loved ones lost and those still living, walked the circular path of the courtyard from 12noon-5pm. Many of the women were sponsored to walk by correctional staff and civilians.<br>

Music was played all day long, and many of the women danced, embraced each other and generally shared some togetherness.<br>

At one point, the music, dancing, and walking stopped to allow for a moment of silence to honor all those lost to AIDS. Then  a reading of names began. As all the names were read, many of the women  held each other, some sat with their heads down and some cried. <br>

These rituals — the names reading, the quilt memorials, the red ribbons, and even the walkathons — have lost some of their impact for many of us on the outside.<br>

Yet on this fall day, in a maximum security prison in upstate New York, never have these rituals meant so much. The women of ACE understand the significance of such ceremonies and the need for a community to express itself in a way that is real, inclusive and pro-active.<br>

And a real, inclusive and pro-active community of women living with AIDS under the yoke of incarceration and in the shadow of a deasth row, supporting each other and giving something back,  is what we found. </i></font></p>

<h2 align=center><i>“What does this day mean to you?”</i></h2>

<h2 align=center><i>Scooby</i></h2> 
<p align=right>This day means a lot to me. People are here today marching for the sick and I’m not well. </p>

<h2 align=center><i>Debra Dinardo Price</i></h2>
<p align=right>I’m dying of AIDS and I lost my husband a year ago. I’m here to help the cause and the children. You get strength from the inside because you feel a sense of support. By breaking the silence, one voice can create more and then you form a unity. </p>

<h2 align=center><i>Liz Mastroieni, Coordinator, ACE Program</i></h2>
<p align=right>This event dispels the myths and stereotypes about women in prison. It’s a very supportive thing. It would not happen without the superintendent. Everyone seems to be supportive of it. In a prison with a death row being built, women still do this. They do this in spite of the apathy. It’s a celebration of women’s liberties even if they are incarcerated. These women nurse each other back to health, and to see that interaction is amazing. One thing I do want to stress is that this day is not about me as a coordinator, this is about them.</p>
<h2 align=center><i>Wanda</i></h2>
<p align=right>I’m here supporting my friend Scooby. I try to make sure she takes her medications and I take care of her when she is ill. I’ve been here for 9 years, and I’ve been here for others when they are sick. It’s very hard when they die.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>Aida Rivera</i></h2>
<p align=right>To me this day is about listening to all the names and remembering those who have passed.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>Moses Coard</i></h2>
<p align=right>I’ve been working in this facility for eleven years. A lot of my friends have died from AIDS. Every year I donate money to the Walkathon and sponsor the women to walk.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>Frenchie Laugier </i></h2>
<p align=right>I am an organizer of this event and worked hard getting it together. I have lost my son, my daughter, and my grandson, as well as a lot of friends, both inside and outside. It felt good to be a part of it and it means a lot to me. </p>

<h2 align=center><i>Judy </i></h2>
<p align=right>I’ve been here for over a decade. In the beginning AIDS was defined by fear, isolation and poor care. It’s gotten worse but now we are starting to build a supportive community. We do education and, by donating money to Incarnation Children’s Center, we can create an opportunity for women to give something back versus it just being about punishment.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>Mona Graves</i></h2> 
<p align=right>I have lost many friends to AIDS. I used to be an AIDS counselor, now I just support others. </p>

<h2 align=center><i>Kathy </i></h2>
<p align=right>This is a community of women who have suffered. So many people have lost people to AIDS, even today. This is a way for people to express their grief. The staff is extremely supportive, with the officers, the administration and the civilian employee sponsoring women and giving money. With some of the money raised going to the Children’s Center, it’s a way for people to give. The Walkathon is a vehicle, a way for these women to have some power. This combination of working together is a very strong thing to feel.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>prisoners' perspectives</i></h2>

<h5 align=center>Prisoners' Perspectives is by and for people in the state and federal prison systems who are living with and exploring ways to deal with HIV. We welcome submissions - please see our <a href="letters.html">editorial policy</a>.</h5>

<hr size=6 width=50% noshade align=center>

<h4 align=center><font size=+3>W</font>HY <font size=+3>D</font>OUBLE <font size=+3>B</font>UNKING IS A <font size=+3>D</font>ANGER TO <font size=+3>O</font>UR <font size=+3>H</font>EALTH</i></h4>
<h5 align=center>by Yusuf A. Shakoor</h5>

<p>Since the administration of George Pataki, the Draco of the Modern Era, has instituted double bunking of prisoners within the state of New York, numerous articles have arisen in various daily newspapers, where Department of Correctional Services’ officials falsely allude that double bunking is a viable, safe and humane approach to addressing the overcrowded prison population in this state.</p>

<p>This ludicrous misinformation can only be accepted by people who are totally ignorant of the human and civil rights violations that already exist in the state prison system. When they speak of the inability of prisoners to contract communicable diseases when being housed together in a 6’ x 8’ cell, using the same toilet bowl, sink, and also being subjected to a clogged and inadequate ventilation system, it can only satisfy the curiosity of someone that doesn’t know any more than what the newspapers are reporting.</p>

<p>Not only has the prison system in New York state been ranked number one in the nation in prisoner deaths due to AIDS, it also ranks number one in the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) cases reported.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis has always been a critical problem in prisons, especially in the crowded and poorly ventilated ones that exist in New York State. But it did not become a crisis until it caused the Department of Correctional Services to require mandatory testing for TB in 1991, when not only 12 prisoners died at various locations, but also one corrections officer. In 1991, 84 confirmed cases of drug-resistant TB were reported in the first ten months.</p>

<p>It is a known fact among prisoners, especially those who strive to be health-conscious and provide care-giving to others, that TB still continues to be contracted in the prison despite the state’s efforts to provide mandatory TB testing once a year. In the first issuance of Tuberculin testing for all prisoners, staff and volunteers within the prison system of this state, Green Haven Correctional Facility had the largest number of reported cases, and a large number of the cases reported surrounded correctional employees. Green Haven also has the largest amount of prisoners doing life sentences in the state.</p>

<p>It must be made known that prisoners or staff who are infected with TB, whose bodies are already immuno-suppressed for any reason, may show little or no reaction to the standard Tuberculin test, which tells us that if a prisoner or staff person is in denial or the medical staff is unaware of any immuno-suppressing disease they may have, there is a strong likelihood that if they have contracted TB, it will go undetected when the Tuberculin test issued.</p>

<p>Since TB is transmitted by the airborne route, people at highest risk are “close contacts” (<i>e.g.</i> persons who sleep, live, work, or otherwise share air with an infectious person through a common ventilation system). Depending on the ventilation in an institution, close contacts could include all cellmates, all inmates and staff on a tier, or all inmates and staff in a building.</p>

<p>In the December 1994 <i>AIDS Surveillance Quarterly Update</i> published by the New York State Department of Health, the article <i>‘’Tuberculosis in Adults with AIDS, New York State”</i>  stated the following, “In New York State, the number of reported cases has declined in the past two years; <i>however, TB incidence in the State remains the highest in the nation...</i> Prison inmates were excluded from the breakdown of cases by region, as their usual residence is not reported. Of 2,879 inmates diagnosed with AIDS, there were 94 cases of pulmonary TB and 130 cases of extra-pulmonary TB.”</p>

<p>Remember these are only the ones known by the Department of Health since they have become aware of their diagnosis of AIDS. What about the many that are in denial and are unaware of having an immuno-suppressed disease that will not show a positive reaction to TB in a Tuberculin test?</p>

<p>With all this information available to them, how can a system that leads the nation in reported cases as well as deaths due to the two most deadly of diseases affecting humanity today be so conclusive in their analysis of the effects of double bunking?</p>

<p>Have we lost our Constitutional right to “the pursuit of life...?” Is it not the objective role of the prison system anymore to provide secure and humane incarceration? Then how can we accept the disinformation being published by the Department of Correctional Services through its spokesperson James Flateau, and its acting Commissioner Philip Coombe?</p>

<p>With prisoners spending more than 10 hours a day cramped in a 6’ x 8’ cell that has its sink and toilet in open view, not only does it increase the risk of contracting a communicable disease in an already disease-critical system, but it is also debilitating to one’s psychological, spiritual and emotional stability and development.</p>

<p>Double bunking of prisoners should be abolished in the state, as a health concern, aside from all the other debilitating factors it breathes.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>miracle baby</i></h2>

<h5 align=center>by Millie Williams</h5>

<blockquote>

<p>Jessica is my miracle baby.  She was born on February 24, 1995. I am HIV positive and she took AZT for her first 6 weeks of life. On August 18, I found out my baby is HIV negative. Some day I will have to explain to my daughter that life may be short for me, but I am glad her life will be longer. She was one of the first babies in the Rose M. Singer Nursery to have a PCR. <i>(Rose M. Singer Center is the NYC Women’s Jail on Rikers Island. The nursery allows for 15 inmate mothers to live with their babies for up to the first 12 months of life.)</i> I could not have had any better news. I felt so happy.</p>

<p>Last spring, two weeks before Mother’s Day, Jessica turned yellow. We went to the hospital. I was allowed to go with her, but in shackles and handcuffs. Nobody but God knows the pain of your child being sick and your not being able to hold her. I was so worried that she had the virus. A mother’s job is to worry and a mother’s job never ends. Jessica got better and came back to the nursery. I never found out what was wrong with her.</p>

<p>The staff has been very good to me and Jessica. Having a child in jail is not as bad as I thought it would be, due to the fact that we have supportive people like the nursery staff, who are loving, caring 
and concerned individuals. So far, I’ve learned to deal with my problems. It ain’t easy but life has its ups and downs. Somehow I’ve managed to come back around and face life’s challenges.</p>

<p>Today Jessica is a healthy, wonderful, beautiful, smart 7 month-old. Her smile is worth millions in gold. My baby and I will be going to a state prison. Hopefully, we will come home soon. Please keep us in your prayers.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>letters from prison</i></h2>

<blockquote><p align=center><font size=-1><i>Ed. Newsline is committed to providing a space for all people living with AIDS, and we work especially hard to ensure that the voices of those otherwise silenced be given the opportunity to be heard. When we decided to do a special issue on AIDS in Prison (September 1995), we had no idea how needed and well-received it would be.  As a result, we have received an outpouring of letters and personal testimonies from prisoners. We are very encouraged to know that we are reaching a population that is marginalized and often dismissed in this epidemic, and encourage anyone who has the desire and the ability to write to us.  Keep those letters coming!</i></font></p>

<hr size=6 width=50% noshade align=center>

<h2 align=center><i>an abundance of love</i></h2>
<h5 align=center>by Joann Feliciano AKA Pagan</h5>

<p>Hi <i>Newsline</i>:</p>

<p align=right>I’m writing from a cell in Bayview Correctional Facility. I’ve just finished reading your September 1995 issue and I got inspired to write. </p>

<p align=right>I was first diagnosed with HIV in June of 1991 when I was in Albion Correctional Facility. At that time I honestly believe that HIV positive inmates were getting better help than now. Today I have full-blown AIDS with cervical and intestinal cancer, epilepsy and asthma, but I fight this with everything I’ve got and more. I’ve experienced more death in jail than in all my few days in the streets. </p>

<p align=right>Today I am a certified AIDS/HIV counselor, and doing so much time has given me the opportunity to get my peers educated through me. We have a support group here called REACH and the lady that helps us keep this group going is an angel. Her name is Mrs. Goff and she is so non-judgmental that it astounds me. I’m here in a program called “Staying Out T.C.I.” and even though I don’t use drugs I have the behaviors of an addict. Here I get so much support sometimes I don’t want to go home. I have three peer sisters who are very pushy when it comes to me being sick and I would like to thank them. V. McCray, J. Gray, P. Chase, and also my wonderful counselors here at T.C.I., R. Sanders and my gremlin who is really raw and bold, Denise Williams — Thank you. But there is one person who I have chosen to live my life with, her name is Betsy Concepcion. She has given me the will and the strength to kick this up the butt with her love. In all my nine years of incarceration, I’ve never loved a woman as much as I love her and she guides me when I feel like giving up. I’ve been lonely all my life, especially with this disease but today I’ve had an abundance of love from her and if she ever reads this — know, Betsy, that your love and my fight keep me alive. </p>

<p align=right>Here we have a Dr. Shethy from Spellman Clinic, Sherri who takes our blood (I call her Mrs. Dracula), Virginia our GYN Madame. They are so special and take their time and they really, really try to ease our pain. There are so many people from the outside that want to and do help us but the facility itself sucks. I have no problem telling anyone that I have AIDS, but these officers don’t care about themselves let alone an inmate. Bayview was introduced to me as the “Drugs and Sex Hotel,” and I believe that most, not all, these officers should get drug screened because most of them are on drugs. But God forbid you complain to the Captain or Superintendent — that’s a no-no.</p>

<p align=right>But I’m fighting the system and this disease, so if they hold my freedom for speaking my mind, oh well. They took my freedom, not my speech, and if I have to yell at the top of my lungs I will, but the truth will be said. Today I’m getting ready to go on a few furloughs with the help of God, but before I sign off I would like to say something to my son Canito. You are my world and my fight comes from wanting to see you grow up into a wonderful man. You are 14 years old and you know I am your mother and you know I am dying but you love me anyway. You are in Puerto Rico teaching your age group what I’ve taught you and I just want to say I love you and I’m so, so proud of you. </p>

<p align=right>Thank you <i>Newsline</i> for giving me the opportunity to yell at the top of my lungs. You have made a dream come true!</p>

<p align=right>To Carmen Lopez, my jail mom, I love and miss you.</p>

<h5 align=center>by Carmen Vasquez</h5>
<p>Dear <i>Newsline</i>:</p>

<p>I hope when this letter reaches all of you at <i>Newsline</i>, it finds you in the very best of health. </p>

<p>As for myself I am better than ever, thanks to all of you at <i>Newsline</i>. I have now learned to accept life.</p>

<p>Also I want to thank you for being there for me every time when I am down and out and call the hotline. <i>(Ed. The AIDS in Prison Project runs a hotline, (212) 674-0800. Prisoners can call collect on Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 3:00 to 8:00 pm.)</i> Willie, Freddie and Mary make me feel very special. You give me the inspiration to make me want to be where you are today.</p>

<p>Like I wrote in my previous articles, I once felt alone but now I have all of you at Newsline and the hotline. You all have taught me that I can do it. I would also like to thank Willie for coming to Albion Correctional Facility and letting us all know that life goes on  and that we are not alone. Willie is very special to us. He made so many women here at Albion come out of denial. Seeing that he made it made them believe that they can do it also. Willie, his wife and son, and all of you at the hotline and <i>Newsline</i> are a gift of life to this earth. </p>

<p>I would also like to mention to all the brothers and sisters who are incarcerated never to feel alone. Everything happens for a reason. As long as we keep fighting for what we believe in we’ll be alright because believe it or not, God is with us 100%.</p>

<p>This is for one of my incarcerated brothers, Danny Diaz. Thank you for your kind words. It doesn’t matter if you are behind a wall, you are still my brother. I would also love for you to write to me and perhaps your fire will light the torch in my struggle and desire to stay alive. Thank you.</p>

<p>To all the ladies in the free world who feel like no one cares, I want you all to know that I was there once and it is no joke. If you need help, ask for it! And if no one ever told you — you are someone! </p>

<p>So thank you again <i>Newsline</i> for coming into my life. I have seven months to go and will do whatever it takes to stay drug free and alive.</p>

<p align=right>Yours truly, Carmen Vasquez, #95G0008 <br>Albion Correctional Facility <br>3595 State School Road, Albion, NY 14411</p>

<h2 align=center><i>still striving</i></h2>

<h5 align=center>by Carrie Rodriguez</h5>

<p>Hi readers,</p>

 <p align=right>I recently wrote an article on keeping on in prison (June 1995). Well since then, I’ve been moved from Rikers Island to Bedford Hills Correctional Facility to Camp Beacon!</p>

<p align=right>Camp Beacon, how can I describe this place? Well for starters, it’s no place for anyone who is HIV positive and symptomatic. They work you hard chopping trees, painting in 90 degree weather, etc. It’s no joke. The medical staff in my opinion aren’t educated well enough on PWAs in general. I thank God some special friends introduced me to this wonderful and educational magazine, Newsline. I’m always up-to-date on any news there is!</p>

<p align=right>Here at this camp it is very hard to get what you need, or I should say, what you are entitled to. Being HIV positive for six years I have overcome my denial and do reach out to my fellow PWAs here in the prison! Many aren’t comfortable enough to come forward, and I don’t blame them because we’re lacking in education on every issue. We’re lacking more volunteers to come to Beacon. As of today we only have one program once a week and even with that these people here don’t work to extend the program!</p>

<p align=right>I’ve read so much and continue to do so. I’ve gotten responses from fellow inmates who feel as I do. I would love to hear from anyone who has any ideas or information that maybe I haven’t received. As far as Danny Vasquez, I love it when I see a fellow PWA take charge and fight in prison <i>(Ed. Danny Vasquez has written numerous informative articles for Newsline regarding prison conditions and self-empowerment for PWAs.)</i> You know it’s almost better than an orgasm. Smile.</p>

<p align=right>My son is now 16 months old and he’s healthy as ever! If, as I have said, anyone, incarcerated or not, is interested in writing me I would really love to hear from you! </p>

<p align=right>Sincerely, Carrie Rodriquez, #95-9-0859 <br>Camp Beacon, P.O. Box 780, Beacon NY 12508</p>

<h2 align=center><i>no need for denial</i></h2>
<h5 align=center>by Francine Rodriquez</h5>
<p>I’m HIV positive. I’m here to share with you my feelings and emotions about this virus. I’ve been diagnosed since 1989. I learned of my results while I was incarcerated. I was devastated. I thought it was the end of the world. I never had any pre- or post-test counseling about the virus so there were things I didn’t know. I went home in 1991 and chose to forget the virus I lived with. I was in denial, of course. I told my parents but they were very uneducated at the time and they were also afraid. I accepted their fear. While outside I continued to do the negative things. After all I was going to die, wasn’t I?</p>

<p>Outside my T-cell count remained in the 1000 range, so I had nothing to worry about. I was still in denial. I decided to tell the man I was involved with before our relationship developed any further. So I took the chance and told him, not knowing what to expect from him. He didn’t lash out, yell or freak. He put his arms around me and told me he loves me and will always be by my side. That I couldn’t understand. And on June 21, 1994, we were married.</p>

<p>I then again became incarcerated, in September, 1994. I was rescued. Yet I still lived in denial. When they spoke about people with the virus I laughed with them. For I had the fear that if I told others I would stand alone. While on Riker’s Island (a New York City jail) I started trial. My T-cell count fell to 715. Holy shit! It started to hit me that the virus was affecting me but still I had no symptoms. I was safe. I blew trial and was sentenced to 6-12. I arrived at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility on June 29. Denial still lived in me and my burden was getting heavier. The first person that I opened up to and told about the virus was a close friend of mine. Yes, the fear of rejection was there. But I needed to speak to someone about it. I wasn’t on good terms with my family. They were hurt. My friend told me about ACE (AIDS Counseling and Education). She told me they had a support group. I was afraid. I didn’t want others to know. So I took a chance and asked her to help me. She agreed. I met Kathy and we spoke one-on-one. After I dropped my heavy load on her she hugged me. I couldn’t understand it, but she hugged me. I attend the support group every Tuesday and Thursday and it feels great. My burden has been lifted. The ladies in the group have been very caring, loving and understanding towards me and this disease.</p>

<p>I came a long way. I still have a long journey ahead of me. I have seen the doctor and he has informed me that my T-cell count has dropped to 628 and I should take AZT and ddI. I couldn’t understand why I had to take medication if I had no symptoms. I picked up the medication and I haven’t taken it. I’m debating. I never wanted to take medication before. But now I’m in a rut. I don’t know if I should take the medication or not. I asked my family and they said the decision was mine. Oh, they have been very supportive and they got educated.</p>

<p>I don’t want to die but yet I don’t want to take the medication. I seek the advice of my peers in the support group. The decision is mine. There are many questions still unanswered about these drugs, AZT and ddI. Sometimes we must make decisions in life that will affect us for the good or for the bad. There is no need for me to be in denial anymore. I can speak out. I’m not ashamed. It is not an isolated issue, it is reality. It is here today and until there is a cure, there is support.</p>

<p>Dear <i>Newsline</i>:</p>

<p align=right>Hi! I’m presently incarcerated at Taconic Correctional Facility and I’m HIV positive. I just finished reading the September 1995 Newsline. Many of the articles about the struggles AIDS/HIV peer counselors/educators go through reflect a lot of what I go through in this facility. I am an AIDS/HIV peer counselor/educator at the CARE program here. When I read about the lack of medical services at other facilities, it makes me say that even though the medical here isn’t at its best, I’m thankful for the treatment I receive. For my sisters and brothers who aren’t as fortunate, I pray that they will hear the cries and noise that affected and infected people who are outside these walls make for us. I am one of the many African-American/Hispanic women who take a stand for the sisters who are sick or in denial. They can feel safe that I or someone in the CARE office will fight to get them to sick call when they wake up with a fever, and just don’t know how to let the corrections officer know that it’s a life or death thing. I do not do it only because I share the anger, fear, worry, hope and pressures around me, but because I know that we are human and are able to be loved and cared for. We have concerns for ourselves and give the same to others — even if we have made wrong choices in life and must pay for these choices with our lives now! I want it to be known to my many brothers and sisters that this fight we fight is one shared throughout the country with strong-willed and whole-hearted real people, infected and affected alike, giving time, energy, caring at all costs for a real cause — for people living with AIDS/HIV who are still living and for those who are still to become infected if we don’t get to them and for those who have died. </p>

<p align=right>I want to give thanks from the depths of my heart to Dept. Hester, Maeya Carr, Mindy Lenetek, Sam River and all the staff at the Women’s Prison Association for everything they do through the CARE office here in Taconic and the ACE office in Bedford Hills, and the people who are in the free world struggling with this virus. Thanks to <i>Newsline</i> for giving me and my brothers and sisters a way to strengthen each other behind these walls of prison and to speak out to society.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>a healthy attitude</i></h2>
<h5 align=center>by Karne Wiegera</h5>

<p>Dear <i>Newsline</i>:</p>
 
<p>I was and am impressed with the September 1995 issue. This issue goes beyond the norm and has touched a nerve that compels me to finally speak out and share the personal treatment I’ve received being HIV positive and under the cloak of the Bureau of Prisons (Federal System).</p>

<p>Upon entering the B of P on a revocation, I made the medical staff aware of my HIV diagnosis and have come to find out that it is the medical staff that reveals an inmate’s HIV status to the officials rather than the officers sharing what they learn through monitoring outgoing mail.  </p>

<p>While at one of the medical facilities, I expressed my desire to give presentations on HIV/AIDS to Drug Abuse Program groups, as I had done this in the past at another institution, where those efforts met with great success. Anyhow, the reaction of the staff at the Federal Medical Center (FMC) was to have me psychologically evaluated.  Wow!  Talk about being surprised, but then, when an inmate wishes to help other inmates, the B & P frowns on this simply because it is not a politically correct thing to do.</p>

<p>I’ve met with mixed results where medical doctors within the B & P knew what they were doing.  At one FCI the MD had prescribed AZT when my CD4  count declined to 600. The Feds prescribe this at 500.  I requested to see the pharmacist to learn about AZT and the first thing the pharmacist said was, “If I were in your shoes, they could not pay me to take AZT!” Enough said.</p>

<p>The medical staff where I am now go out of their way to assist me.  I’m prescribed multi-vitamins, they’ve encouraged outside assistance and have made it possible for me to receive visits and pen pals through the local AIDS volunteers.  The local MD informed me that the B & P is now looking at allowing the use of ddI as well. To me, that’s a plus because they are at least making some progress with prescribing  something other than AZT.</p>

<p>To all of my follow positive inmates (male or female) throughout — I encourage you to find someone trustworthy and share your thoughts.  Maintain  a low profile and a healthy attitude and shove aside thoughts of giving up. To those of you that are soon to be released, or are already out, don’t forget about those left behind, help them in their struggle to survive.  They are only $.32 away and to receive mail means so much. </p>

<p>Take care and remain steadfast.</p>

<hr size=6 align=center width=50% noshade>

<h2 align=center><i>good ol’ boy politics</i></h2>

<h5 align=center>by April Stewart, Community Connections, North Carolina</h5>

<p>With measured scrutiny, one could easily say that the South is notorious for breeding creatures of ignorance, which of course evolves into chaotic prejudices and utter turmoil, complete discord within communities trying to function together.  It happened a century ago, fifty years ago, ten and twenty years ago, and according to one Asheville citizen and his family, it is still happening.</p>

<p>The Swain County Violent Crime Task Force, established in early May of this year to investigate a series of violent crimes, fires and area burglaries, some dating back 20 years, recently reported the arrests of eight people in connection with these crimes.  A total of 79 counts of felony was reported, as well as $100,000 in stolen property and 1 million dollars in fire damages, according to Swain County Sheriff Bob Ogle.</p>

<p>As of July 1995, among those individuals arrested were Nathan Brookshire and his partner Tim Cagle, both of Asheville.  Brookshire was charged with breaking and entering and 2nd degree burglary.  Bond was set at $26,000.</p>

<p>“There was a third party involved who hasn’t been found since that night,” said Brookshire.  “I was in the car with him and this other person.  We stopped to pick up some things that the driver of the car said belonged to him.  After we left, [with the items mentioned] there was an accident, because the police started chasing us and we kept going.  Tim wasn’t there, and I didn’t know what was going on...but we were in Tim’s car, and I can’t prove I’m innocent.  But I am, and so is Tim.  He has nothing to do with any of this.”</p>

<p>Within weeks, Brookshire, who is 27 and has been diagnosed with AIDS, was released into the custody of his parents.  Shortly following his release, on August 31 Brookshire was apprehended again at his home.  Cagle, also stricken with AIDS, was arrested as well on the same charges of breaking and entering and 2nd degree burglary, in spite of the fact that he was not there the night of the alleged crimes.</p>

<P>After his July arrest, Brookshire’s family contacted the Western North Carolina AIDS Project (WNCAP), due to concerns over the possible discriminatory behavior toward Nathan, which led to correspondence with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on the grounds that Brookshire was “being denied medical attention...being verbally harassed about his AIDS status by jail staff and officers...and being housed in isolation based on his status as a prisoner living with AIDS.”</p>

<p>As documented by the ACLU, one officer was reported as saying, “He deserves whatever he gets,” regarding Brookshire’s current health status.</p>

<p>During this apportioned correspondence, AIDS Information Coordinator Jackie Walker made attempts to communicate with the Swain County Sheriff’s Department, offering correct information on how to properly care for and treat individuals with AIDS.  Walker also cautioned the Department of its reported discriminatory behavior, advising that other, similar situations in the past have resulted in “a number of lawsuits...filed in various states overturning inhumane policies that had been applied to prisoners with HIV/AIDS.”</p>

<p>According to Sandy Brookshire, Nathan’s sister, the ACLU’s intervention seemed to make things worse during his stay in jail.</p>

<p>“Mark Melrose, Nathan’s attorney, pulled our mother aside during a recess at one of the court hearings and said they raised the bond from $26,000 to $50,000 after and because the ACLU got involved,” Brookshire said, in reference to her brother’s situation.  She also commented on several specific instances of mental and physical abuse against both Tim and Nathan by the Swain County Sheriff’s Department, requesting that the details not be released to the public for fear of possibly harming Nathan and Tim’s chances of being found innocent.</p>

<p>“My brother and Tim are innocent.  They’re both going to eventually die, and here they are going through something like this,” she said.</p>

<p>At present, Cagle has not been appointed an attorney.  He cannot afford the expenses and therefore is at the mercy of the court.  Expenses for the Brookshire family have grown to such proportions that they may lose land and property in order to accommodate their son with medical supplies and a proper defense.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what will happen if we don’t get Tim a lawyer,” said Brookshire who was released on September 26, again to the custody of his family.  “I’m here at home with my family for now, waiting for trial for something I didn’t even do and Tim doesn’t even have a lawyer.  I’m glad to be with my family, but I’m lost without him here.  We’ve been together for six years.  Now a major part of me is missing.”</p>

<p>The Brookshire family, like any family, care for their son very much and are supporting him and Tim in every way.  They are hoping for a positive outcome during the October-set trial, although expectations are not incredibly positive.</p>

<p>“It’s a good ol’ boy system...This is the 90s; I thought all of that was over, but I guess I was wrong.  It makes me sick to be called a Southerner,” said Brookshire, adding that she has spent the last several months trying to contact organizations that will offer some assistance and support for Nathan and Tim.</p>

<p>To date, both men have been released to the custody of their parents.  Both are awaiting trial.  And if things go as planned, along with the ACLU and WNCAP, there will be a representative from the NAACP intervening in their defense.  For their families, innocence is not the question.  The court system apparently sees it differently.  However, when approached, the Swain County Sheriff’s Department had no comment on this matter.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in offering support of any kind to the Brookshire or Cagle families, please contact:</p>

<h2 align=center><i>humane alternatives for inmates with AIDS/HIV</i></h2>

<p>Educating the judicial system and the diversion of criminal defendants with AIDS/HIV from incarceration are the double-edged focus of a new collaborative project of San Francisco’s Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice (CJCJ) and the Catholic Charities of the East Bay’s (CCED) HIV/AIDS in Prison Project.</p>

<p>Funded by a grant from the San Francisco AIDS Foundation’s AIDS Walk 1995, the California HIV/AIDS Advocacy and Alternative Sentencing Project will provide trainings for judges, prosectors and public defendants on issues affecting criminal defendants with HIV/AIDS. The projects will also prepare alternative sentencing and compassionate release cases for criminal defendants and prisoners with HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p>The new collaborative project will develop and promote a network of advocacy and support for HIV positive defendants among AIDS service providers and public health professionals.</p>

<p>According to Judy Greenspan of the HIV/AIDS in Prison Project, “three strikes you’re out” legislation and the subsequent graying of the prison population necessitate a campaign to divert both criminal defendants and prisoners with AIDS from prison. “Poor medical care and the stress of prison life can turn a short prison term into a death sentence,” Greenspan said.</p>

<p>Karol Heppe of the Alternative Sentencing Program added, “We hope to provide judges and prosecutors with a more humane alternative than incarceration for this population.”</p>

<p>Over the past year, CCEB’s AIDS in Prison Project has supported compassionate release legislation (Assembly Bill 1408), as well as individual compassionate release cases. CJCJ’s Alternative Sentencing Program promotes safe and effective use of alternatives to incarceration. This new project is the first collaboration between the two programs.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>medical matters</i></h2>

<blockquote>
<h2 align=center><i>new approaches for the prophylaxis and treatment <br>of opportunistic infections</i></h2>

<h5 align=center>by Lawrence M. Prescott, Ph.D.</h5>    

<p><img hspace=5 align=right src="gifs/iv.gif">More than 12,000 physicians, infectious disease specialists, research scientists, and other healthcare professionals gathered from around the world at the 35th Interscience on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy to hear the latest findings in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.  Special emphasis was paid to HIV/AIDS and AIDS-related opportunistic infections.  Listed below are a few of the highlights of particular interest to people living with HIV/AIDS.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>valaciclovir for CMV prophylaxis</i></h2>

<p>Administration of the new antiviral agent valaciclovir (Valtrex®, Glaxo Wellcome) to people with advanced HIV disease produces a definite preventive effect against cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, according to Dr. Judith Feinberg from John Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>

<p><img hsapce=5 align=left src="gifs/pill.gif">When high doses of valaciclovir (2 gm four times daily) are given to HIV positive people with very low CD4+ cell counts (median—32), CMV disease occurs much less frequently and when it does occur, the time to development of confirmed CMV disease is significantly longer.  Furthermore, valaciclovir treatment seems to confer some level of survival benefit, with a trend toward lower mortality rates in valaciclovir-treated individuals compared to persons given the more standard prophylactic approach of acyclovir. </p>

<h2 align=center><i>ganciclovir implant for CMV treatment</i></h2>    
     
<p>A novel ganciclovir (Cytovene®, Roche) intraocular device is proving to be a clinically important improvement over intravenous (IV) ganciclovir in the delay of progression of CMV retinitis, reported Dr. Baruch Kupperman, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California.</p>

<p>In a large-scale, multicenter, clinical trial, when people with newly diagnosed, untreated CMV retinitis were randomly assigned to either IV ganciclovir or a sustained-release intraocular device implanted surgically continuing one of two different doses of ganciclovir, time to disease progression was much longer with the intraocular implant than with IV ganciclovir, being 194 days versus 72 days respectively.  Overall survival was the same in both treatment groups, at 140 days in the implanted patients and 150 days for those on IV ganciclovir.</p>


<h2 align=center><i>clarithromycin for MAC prophylaxis</i></h2>     

<p>Last year it was pointed out that clarithromycin (Biaxin®, Abbott) is very effective in the prevention of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection in people with advanced AIDS.  In the latest clinical trial, clarithromycin prophylaxis of MAC infection has been shown to have a decidedly positive effect on survival in those severely immunocompromised persons with AIDS, stated Dr. Mark Pierce from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee.  This positive benefit on survival is due primarily to clarithromycin’s ability to prevent MAC infections, since having a MAC infection increases the chances of death significantly in people with advanced AIDS.</p>

<p><img hspace=5 align=right src="gifs/pill.gif">When people were given clarithromycin, their average survival period was over 700 days compared to only 537 days for persons who received placebo.  In addition, death from any cause was reduced by 28% when people were given clarithromycin prophylaxis.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>triple combo for treatment of MAC bacteremia</i></h2>

<p>A three-drug combination of clarithromycin, rifabutin  (Mycobutin®, Pharmacia Adria), and ethambutol (Myambutol®, Wyeth-Ayerst) is far superior to a four-drug combination of ciprofloxacin (Cipro®, Miles), ethambutol, rifampin  (Rifadin®, Marion Merrell Dow), and clofazimine (Lamprene®, Geigy), according to Dr. S. D. Shafran from the University of Alberta School of Medicine in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and a spokesperson for the Canadian MAC Study Group.</p>

<p><img hspace=5 align=left alt=" " src="gifs/pill.gif">In people with MAC infections in the blood, administration of the three-drug combo resulted in eradication of the bacteria from the bloodstream in 69% of treated individuals versus clearing of the blood in 30% of persons who received the four-drug combo.  Furthermore, people given the three-drug combination lived longer than those on the four-drug therapy.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>fluconazole for cryptococcal meningitis</i></h2>

<p>Fluconazole (Diflucan®, Roerig) at 200 mg daily is preferred to itraconazole (Sproanox®, Janssen) at 200 mg daily as maintenance therapy of AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis, said Dr. Michael S. Saag from the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p>

<p><img hspace=5 align=right alt=" " src="gifs/iv.gif">In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, clinical trial, among 107 eligible people with AIDS-related cryptococcal meningitis, only two of 52 (3.8%) who received fluconazole experienced documented, cerebrospinal fluid-culture-positive relapses compared to 13 of 55 persons (23.6%) assigned to itraconazole.  While 19 people died during the study, none of the deaths in either treatment group was caused by cryptococcal disease.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>itraconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis</i></h2>

<p><img hspace=5 align=left alt=" " src="gifs/pillbot.gif">Itraconazole oral solution for seven to fourteen days is well tolerated and at least as effective as standard therapy with fluconazole for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV-positive people, and may be more effective at 14 days, noted Dr. John R. Graybill from the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, Texas.  This provides the person with a useful alternative treatment to fluconazole therapy.</p>

<p>Success, measured as all candidiasis lesions clearing, was seen in 83% of people on itraconazole for seven days, 87% of those on fluconazole for 14 days, and 97% of persons receiving itraconazole for 14 days.  Relapse was reported in 59% of the people on itraconazole for seven days, 50% of individuals on fluconazole for 14 days, and 44% of persons taking itraconazole for 14 days. </p>

<h2 align=center><i>effects of influenza vaccination</i></h2>

<p><i>This note is added because of its major significance to all HIV positive people, especially with flu season coming on.</i></p>

<p>Annual influenza vaccination may be harmful for HIV positive individuals, asserted Dr. Sybil Tasker, Naval Medical Center, San Diego, California.</p>

<p><img hspace=5 align=right alt " " src="gifs/shot.gif">A recent study pointed out that mean plasma HIV increased from 23,892 copies/ml at the start of the study up to 135,873 copies/ml in the persons vaccinated against influenza while during the same period, individuals who were given a placebo actually had a decrease in viral burden.  Since influenza does not cause excess morbidity or mortality in HIV positive people, the use of influenza vaccination might be held in abeyance until further evaluation is made of this practice.</p>

<h2 align=center><i>medical briefs</i></h2>
<p align=center><img src="gifs/darkorch.gif" width=550 height=8 alt=" "></p>

<blockquote><h2><i>Kaposi’s sarcoma treatment approved</i></h2>

<p>SEQUUS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Liposome Technology, Inc.) has received FDA approval for DOXIL® (pegylated-liposomal doxorubicin HCI) injection as a treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS).</p>

<p>The current New Drug Application (NDA) for DOXIL is directed toward the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma for people in whom prior systemic combination chemotherapy has failed either due to disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. SEQUUS is also conducting clinical trials directed toward the possible future filing of NDA supplements to gain approval of DOXIL as first-line therapy for KS and for the treatment of certain solid tumors.</p>

<p>Permission to market DOXIL will be granted following the company’s satisfactory response to FDA questions posed in the approval letter regarding routine chemistry, manufacturing and control processes.</p>

<p>In February 1995, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) recommended that the FDA approve DOXIL in accordance with the agency’s accelerated approval regulations. Accelerated approval regulations require generally that an applicant (in this case SEQUUS) study an investigational drug following product launch to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. SEQUUS personnel are working with the FDA in designing a “post-marketing” clinical study to meet accelerated approval requirements.</p>

<p>DOXIL is a long-circulation STEALTH liposome formulation of the widely prescribed anti-cancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride. SEQUUS is developing the drug for treating various forms of advanced cancer, including AIDS-related KS and solid tumors. The anticipated approval to use DOXIL for AIDS-related KS will be the first approved utilization of the drug.</p>

<hr size=6 width=50% align=center noshade>

<h2><i>expanded access for new CMV treatment</i></h2>

<p>The Food and Drug Administra-tion (FDA) has authorized investigational new drug (IND) treatment status for intravenous cidofovir (Vistide) for HIV positive people with relapsing cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis that has progressed despite treatment. CMV retinitis is an eye infection that can lead to blindness in individuals with impaired immune systems, as is the case with AIDS. </p>

<p>FDA established the treatment IND mechanism for people suffering from serious or life-threatening conditions who have exhausted existing treatments or have no satisfactory treatments. The treatment IND process allows individuals to obtain  promising experimental drugs that have undergone sufficient clinical testing to show that they may be safe and effective. In this case, the FDA granted expanded access, based on a controlled clinical trial that indicated that intravenous cidofovir may slow the progression of CMV retinitis. </p>

<p>FDA has already approved two drugs for treating CMV retinitis: foscarnet and ganciclovir. Neither drug cures CMV retinitis, but they can significantly delay disease progression.</p>

<p>Gilead Sciences Inc., of Foster City, CA, is making the drug available free of charge in this treatment IND program. Individuals and health care professionals can obtain more information about the treatment IND and its enrollment criteria by calling 1-800-GILEAD5. For more information on other AIDS clinical trials, call 1-800-TRIALS-A.</p>

<hr align=center size=6 width=50% noshade>

<h2><i>new clinical trial for cryptosporidium starts</i></h2>

<p>Unimed Pharmeceuticals, Inc. has announced the beginning of a Phase II clinical trial to test the saftey and efficacy of its new product nitazoxanide (NTZ) for treating Cryptospordium in people with AIDS. Unimed received the FDA’s approval this past September to proceed with the trial based on its investigational new drug (IND) application, filed in August. The clinical trial will be conducted at Cornell Medical Center in New York City under the direction  of Dr. Rosemary Soave, Department of Infectious Disease, an internationally known Cryptosporidium expert.</p>

<p>Approximately 15 to 20 percent of people with AIDS suffer from Cryptosporidium parvum. While this gastrointestinal parasite causes temporary diarrhea in those with fully-functioning immune systems, it may result in profound chronic diarrhea in PWAs. There is currently no approved treatment for cryptosporidium.</p>

<h2><i>clarithromycin reduces mortality in relation to MAC</i></h2>

<p>The antibiotic clarithromycin has been proven to prolong life in people with advanced HIV infection by disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), researchers reported at the 35th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.</p>

<P>MAC, the most common systemic bacterial infection in people with advanced AIDS, has been confirmed post-mortem in more than 50 percent of PWAs.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that one in every four people living with AIDS has disseminated MAC. Several retrospective studies have demonstrated that MAC increases morbidity and decreases survival in PWAs.</p>

<p>Mark Pierce, M.D., of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, presented results from a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-center study, conducted in the United States and Europe. The study was designed to assess the ability of clarithromycin to prevent MAC infections and its effect on overall survival of patients.</p>

<p>A total of 682 patients were given either clarithromycin 500 mg or placebo twice daily. During the study and follow-up, only 5.9 percent (19/341) in the group receiving clarithromycin developed MAC compared to 19 percent (53/341) in the group receiving placebo. This represents a 69 percent reduction in the risk of developing disseminated MAC.</p>

<p>Median survival was greater than 700 days for the clarithromycin recipients compared to 573 days for placebo recipients. Placebo recipients who were MAC positive had a relative risk of death of 2.6 compared to those who were MAC negative. This prospective trial demonstrated that MAC is a predictor of mortality. The favorable effect of clarithromycin on survival in advanced AIDS is due primarily to the prevention of MAC.</p>

<p>“Patients with advanced AIDS who are severely immuno-compromised are at high risk for the onset of opportunistic infections, such as disseminated MAC,” says Dr. Mark Pierce, lead investigator of the study. “When used as a preventive agent, clarithromycin can reduce the risk of disseminated MAC. More importantly, the study has shown that the prophylactic use of clarithromycin extends the lives of patients with advanced AIDS.” </p>

<p>Resistance, which is a particular concern with monotherapy in the treatment of AIDS, is an important issue in MAC prophylaxis. Of the patients randomized to clarithromycin only three percent (11/341) developed resistant strains of MAC. Clarithromycin-resistant MAC was seen only in people with CD4 counts of 25 cells/mm3 or less and only after a time of 385 days of prophylaxis. This evidence suggests that clarithromycin-resistant MAC may represent treatment failure in patients who had non-bacterial MAC infections at the start of prophylaxis. Therefore, clarithromycin resistance should be minimized by reliably excluding MAC prior to initiation of prophylaxis, especially in patients with baseline CD4 counts 25 cells/mm3 or less.</p>

<p>In April 1995, Abbott Laboratories submitted a Supple-mental New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking marketing approval for the use of clarithromycin for the prevention of MAC in people with advanced HIV infection. Clarithromycin is marketed in the U.S. under the brand name Biaxin®.
Oral Cytovene Prophylaxis For CMV Disease Infrequently Associated with Viral Resistance</p>

<p>New data presented at the 35th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in San Francisco suggest that prophylactic therapy with oral Cytovene® (ganciclovir capsules) is infrequently associated with the development of cytomegalovirus (CMV) resistance (one percent). The preliminary resistance data from this study are encouraging, especially when coupled with earlier study findings that preventative treatment with oral Cytovene® decreases the incidence of CMV disease by 49 percent.</p>

<p>“Taken as a whole, the available data from study 1654 indicates that in HIV infected persons, oral Cytovene® prophylaxis decreases the risk of developing CMV disease without increasing the risk of viral resistance,” said Lawrence W. Drew, M.D., University of California, San Francisco, one of the principal investigators of the study. “The preliminary resistance data are quite reassuring.”</p>

<p>CMV disease is the most common opportunistic infection in the late stages of AIDS. The most frequent manifestation of CMV disease is CMV retinitis, an infection of the retina of the eye which can be sight-threatening. (CMV retinitis is the most common ophthalmological complication of AIDS; up to 40 percent of patients eventually develop the condition.</p>

<p>Cytovene® (ganciclovir) inhibits the ability of the virus to replicate, thereby slowing the progression of the disease. Cytovene® capsules are currently indicated as an alternative to the intravenous (I.V.) formulation for maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis in people with impaired immune systems whose CMV retinitis is stable following appropriate I.V. therapy and only in those for whom the risk of more rapid disease progression is balanced by the benefit associated with avoiding daily I.V. infusions.</p>

<hr size=6 width=50% align=center noshade>

<h2><i>effective prevention</i></h2>

<p>Study 1654 is a multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of oral ganciclovir for the prevention of CMV disease. The study comprises 725 persons with HIV (CD4 cells less than or equal to 100) — 486 subjects were randomized to oral ganciclovir and 239 to a placebo control. A planned interim analysis completed in July 1994 demonstrated the significant efficacy of ganciclovir over placebo, and an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended discontinuation of the placebo arm of the study. A delay of eight months in the onset of disease was seen in 20 percent of patients in whom this analysis was possible.</p>

<p>“Results of this study have demonstrated that CMV prophylaxis with oral Cytovene® is associated with a 49 percent risk reduction in the development of CMV disease compared with placebo,” said Dr. Drew. “In addition prophylactic therapy was generally well-tolerated among these patients.”</p>

<p>At the dosages used in the prevention study (3 grams daily), the most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal. The incidences of anemia, neutropenia (a decrease in the number of neuutrophilic leukocytes in the blood), and elevated serum creatinine were higher in the group receiving oral Cytovene® compared to the group receiving placebo.</p>

<hr size=6 width=50% align=center noshade>

<h2><i>development of viral resistance rare</i></h2>

<p>At ICAAC, Dr. Drew presented an analysis of isolates from patients who participated in the 1654 prevention study and received at least 90 days of treatment. The results indicate that prevalence of resistance was very low (one percent) after a mean of 10 months of preventive treatment. Resistant virus was associated with later treatment failure in one patient.</p>

<p>In May 1995, Syntex (now Roche Bioscience, a member of the Roche group) submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA based on the results of study 1654. The company is requesting marketing clearance for the use of oral Cytovene® for prevention of CMV disease in HIV positive individuals at risk.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>PLEASE POST and copy and otherwise widely distribute to PWAs</p>		

<p>There is a limited supply of Merck's new protease inhibitor <a href="../../network/simple/indi.html">Crixivan</a>.

<p>If you are enrolled in a Crixivan trial, you will either be offered a long-term follow-up trial, with free drug; or you will be given a transition card and guaranteed a spot in the following program. If you want to keep getting Crixivan, don't hesitate to call the number below.</p>

<p>If you are not in a trial, to order Crixivan in 1996:</p>

<ol>
<li>Call 1(800) 927-8888, the Stadtlanders Crixivan hotline. This line is open 8:30 AM-9 PM EST.
<p>
<li>Your doc (not you) faxes your prescription on their one page enrollment form, to Stadtlanders. The fax # is: (800) 682-7436. For more enrollment forms, doctors can call (412)825-8169.
<p>
<li>Stadtlanders takes up to 48 hours to check on your insurance coverage. They will call you back within 48 hours to let you know if you are covered. If you are covered, they will ship drug to you, starting Monday, 3/25/96.
<p>
<dt>Merck is guaranteeing that once you are accepted in this mail order system, and are receiving Crixivan, they will not cut you off.
<p>
<li>If you are not covered, you can pay for the drug directly (credit card, cash, check). They ship COD if you do not have a credit card.
<p>
<li>If you can't afford to pay for Crixivan, they will refer you to a <a href="../../network/access/pa/indi.html">Patient Assistance Program</a>. We do not know the income limits for this program. Once you are accepted into the Patient Assistance Program for free drug, Merck guarantees that you can stay in that program. Patient Assistance: 1-800-850-3430 or 1-800-927-8888.
</ol>
</blockquote>
<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=2 width=400>
<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Once your HMO, Medicaid, ADAP or insurance company decides not to cover Crixivan, you will NOT be eligible for Patient Assistance, no matter how little you earn. BUT you are eligible for this program if your ADAP, Medicaid or an HMO has not yet decided. And once you're in, you're in for good. That's what Merck has promised. SO--the sooner you sign up, the better.</p>

<p>Crixivan is a new protease inhibitor. There is no safety data on use past six months. The only data on using this drug with two other antivirals, AZT/3TC, is from a study of 24 people for only seven months. As with all the protease inhibitors, there are many, many drugs you cannot take while you are taking Crixivan. In the year to come, there will be much more information on how and if to take this drug. And the supply problem should be over by the end of 1996. </p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>suggestions for starting Norvir therapy - the times they are a-changing 5/96</h3>

<p><a href="../../network/simple/riton.html">Norvir</a>, Abbott's protease inhibitor, was approved to be taken at 600mg bid (2x a day), based on a large study showing a survival benefit in PWAs with less than 100 CD4s. Abbott now recommends that everyone take Norvir at a low dose, and increase the dose over several days, "dosing up" to the full dose by Day 14. This may lessen the common side effects of Norvir: diarrhea, vomiting, bloating and cramping.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why does the starting dose matter?
<p>
<dt>One, we don't know if starting with a lower dose will lessen Norvir's side effects. It hasn't been studied. Lower doses were better tolerated in trials. There's a reason to be wary: this company stated repeatedly through the approval process that their new capsule form would be better tolerated than the original liquid form. They offered no data, and ignored the 30% dropout rate in their French trial with capsules.
<p>
<dt>Two, we don't know if dosing-up gives you Norvir's maximum benefit, or what it means for resistance. It takes your liver a while to 'learn' to process Norvir, so for the first 3-4 days, your blood levels of Norvir are higher than ever again. By Day 14, your liver has learned to process an even amount of the drug, and taking the 600mg bid dose results in a smaller, steady amount of active drug in your blood. This is important, because right now we don't know if having high blood levels in the beginning few days is an advantage, or meaningless. 
<p>
<dt>In the Abbott trial, everyone took the prescribed 600mg bid dose, so everyone in that trial had the initial high burst of active drug. Within ten days, there was a significant difference in survival and new infections between the group that took Norvir and the group that didn't. This difference peaked at week 4, and remained constant through the next 5 months of the trial. Abbott researchers argue that the survival benefit happened because of the average viral suppression reached by Day 14. They say that since dosing-up will give you the equivalent of that average viral suppression, everything should be okay. This trial does not give us the answer either way. We don't know, and probably won't ever, as Abbott has no plans to compare dose escalation v. regular dosing. What a surprise.

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=2 width=400>
<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>

<li>What was studied
<p>
<dt>A - Phase II/III trials: PWAs started and took 600mg bid through the trials
<p>
<dt>B - Earlier dose-ranging trials: Norvir has an extremely tiny 'therapeutic window'--there's not much leeway in how you can take this drug, in order to get its maximum benefit. 400mg bid didn't show enough clinical benefit, and more than 600mg bid wasn't tolerated. At all doses, some people had cramping, diarrhea, bloating and vomiting.
<p>
<li>Abbott's current recommendations (count 'em - three)
<p>
<dt>A- In the package insert, they suggest taking 5 days to get up to full dose: Day 1-300mg bid; days 2&3-400mg bid; day 4-500mg bid; day 5 & on-600mg bid
<p>
<dt>B - In their follow-up trial, they suggest taking 7 days to get up to full dose:

</ol>
<center><table border=1 width=90%><tr><th>Days 1 &amp 2</th><p><th>days 3 &amp 4</th><p><th>days 5 &amp; 6</th><p><th>day 7 &amp; on</th><p></tr><tr><td>2-300mg bid</td><p><td align=center>4-400mg bid</td><p><td align=center>6-500mg bid</td><p><td>600mg bid AND, if stomach problems persist, go back down to 500 mg bid (<a href="#you">see below</a>)</td><p></tr></table></center>
<ol>

<dt>C- Abbott researchers are now suggesting in meetings to take up to 14 days to get to the full dose:
</ol>
<center><table border=1 width=90%><tr><th>Days 1 &amp; 2</th><p><th>days 3 &amp; 4</th><p><th>days 5 through 13</th><p><th>day 14</th><p></tr><tr><td align=center>300mg bid</td><p><td align=center>400mg bid</td><p><td align=center>500mg bid</td><p><td align=center>600mg bid</td><p></tr></table></center>
<ol>
<dt><a name="you">You</a> must reach 600 mg bid by day 14. But then the instructions get confusing. "If you can't tolerate 600mg bid, you can stay at 500mg bid." The 500mg dose is not the approved dose. In dose-ranging studies, 500mg bid had a less sustained effect on both viral load and CD4 cells. 

</ol>

<p>So, what's the take home message? Check your viral load, talk to your doctor, maybe take 600 mg bid from the first day to see if you can tolerate it (lots of people can), and if you can't tolerate it, dose up to full dose by Day 14. </p>

<p>This 4 day 'dose escalation' protocol may provide some relief, and help people stay on the drug, as opposed to quitting Norvir for good after feeling terribly sick. But neither this 'dose escalation' protocol, nor other protocol that escalates the dosage for up to two weeks, have been studied yet for Norvir. </p>

<p>In fact, it takes your <a href="liver.html">liver</a> a while to 'learn' to process Norvir, so the levels of the drug in your blood are initially higher than they would be eventually. We do not know what this means. One interpretation is that the lower initial doses are fine because blood levels are higher, translating into a clinical benefit similar to regular dosing. The second interpretation, based in the 1,000 person clinical endpoint study that got the drug approved, questions the efficacy of dose escalation, because the greatest benefit was seen within the first month of therapy. Would the benefit be lost with lower initial doses? We don't know, and unfortunately, we probably won't know, as Abbott doesn't have any studies planned to compare dose escalation and regular dosing.</p>

<p>The main problem is that Norvir has an extremely tiny 'therapeutic window.' This means that 400mg twice a day didn't seem to be of clinical benefit and more than 600mg twice a day was not tolerated (not that a lot of people can't even take 600mg). Norvir was approved by the FDA at 600mg bid, not because it was the most effective dose, but because it is the maximum that is tolerated. Abbott Labs was allowed by the FDA to include a strangely open-ended suggestion in in their package insert for Norvir: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"The recommended dosage of ritonavir is 600 mg twice daily by mouth. Some patients experience nausea upon initiation of 600 mg b.i.d. dosing; dose escalation may provide some relief: 300 mg b.i.d. dosing for 1 day, 400 mg b.i.d. dosing for 2 days, 500 mg dosing for 1 day, and then 600 mg b.i.d. thereafter. In addition, patients initiating combination regimens with NORVIR and nucleosides may improve gastrointestinal tolerance by intitiating NORVIR alone and subsequently adding nucleosides before completing two weeks of NORVIR monotherapy." </i></p></blockquote>

<font size=-1>
<p><b><a name="rant">Ranting</a> at Merck</b><br>
This rant was written and sent to community activists and organizations around the country on March 14.</p>

<p>We met on 3/13/96 with activists and Merck & Co.’s merry marketeers, so that they could lay out for us their so-called plan to distribute, sell, and continue to study Crixivan, our newest friendly protease inhibitor. Well, they were more than willing to admit that their plan was probably unfair, totally complicated, and barely not fodder for a fabulous anti-trust lawsuit. But Merck pleaded for mercy (which some activists who attended this mini-meeting were more than willing to give), because they had to devise this so quickly, and they were being rushed, pushed by the FDA to get Crixivan into the market-I’d rush too if I could make $131,000,000 in a year like the Merckies. So, Crixivan was approved by the FDA, probably within minutes of our sorry backsides walking out the door of Merck’s visitors compound in Blue Bell, PA. The only really good news is that Merck’s base price is way cheaper than Norvir or Invirase-$4,380 per year ($12 per day). BUT they cut a sweetheart deal with Stadtlanders, so the retail price sucks. (see <a href="#price">pricing</a>).</p>

<p>CRIXIVAN WILL NOT BE SOLD IN DRUG STORES!!! It will be distributed only through Stadtlanders, a mail order pharmacy service, at least until October. This will happen ON A FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE BASIS. There is no priority for patients with low CD4, or high viral load. The Merckies claim, and this really burns us, that they ‘can’t play God’, and that any type of patient priority would be too complicated to be economically feasible. As if they are not already playing God by making people jump through flaming hoops for an expensive, gel-capped powder they hope might save their lives. Also, it was too late to change the plan (DUH!!! -the meeting for ‘community’ input finished one minute before they were legally able to implement the stupid plan!!). The Merckies asked that we tell them if we hear of problems (AS IF!!! Stadtlanders doesn’t accept Medicaid in 28 states, usually charges more than most drug stores, -ugghhh. Surprise, surprise, the stories are rolling in. Last week one Crixivan customer waiting for drug, was bugged for his credit card by none other than Gregg Perelman, Pres. of Stadtlanders - doesn’t he have better things to do? And if they’re so broke, shouldn’t someone else be distributing Crixivan?)</p>

<p>The patient assistance program is trademarked SUPPORT , hilariously. Merck refused to tell us what the income limit is, so we can’t tell you whether to apply or not. But trust them, Merck PR-types said, it will be generous. Of course we have no way to know-the info’s all proprietary, you see. NOTE:you can apply for patient assistance even if your HMO, ADAP, or Medicaid has not decided yet to cover Crixivan. The Merckies claim that they’re working with the VA (the US’s largest health care provider to PWAs) and prison systems, but gave no detail-so we’ll just have to see how much drug gets up the river in the next 4 weeks.</p>

<p>WHY SUCH A PAIN? Merck tells us that their (money-clutching) hands are tied. First, they don’t have enough Crixivan to supply it to everyone, and they need to ensure that everyone has a steady supply to avoid speeding up HIV resistance. OK, That’s serious enough. The rumor in certain circles is that Merck conservatively estimates it has enough Crixivan to continually supply 30,000 patients until their new factory is finished next Fall, when there will be enough Crixivan to feed it to the pigeons and fertilize your garden with it. Protease inhibitors, a totally new class of drug, were developed and approved by the FDA faster than any drugs in the past. Because of this, we have literally NO information about how long Crixivan works, how it works with other drugs, how long it takes HIV to become resistant to it, why and which people respond very well or not at all, and what the long term side effects of taking Crixivan are. Merck stated that they will compile ‘long term’ safety data in a small number of people for 3-5 years, but would only commit to the first year. This data will be from patients who enrolled in phase II trials (#s 4,6,10,18,19,20,21,35) and one phase III trial (#39), for a total of ‘around’ 800 patients. They will continue to receive Crixivan for free and get their labs, blood counts, and viral RNA counted through Merck. ¡Horrores! Merck won’t give these patients their own viral load counts on a regular basis as they are taken. Why? Could it be that Merck doesn’t want people to stop Crixivan when they find out they have developed resistance? So much for the standard of care.</p>

<p>If you’re in this long term follow-up program, you can’t take any other protease inhibitors, and new experimental drugs (non-FDA approved, study drugs) will be reviewed on a case by case basis by Merckian wizards. The other 2200 people in Merckian programs, including those in their limited expanded access program (a.k.a. restricted marketing access program), will be "rolled into commercial access" (as though buying prescription drugs at the drug store is a whole new access program.)</p>

<p>YAY, PRICE!! BOO, DISTRIBUTION!! This distribution looks like it will be complicated, complicated, complicated, which sucks. The supply issue could have been worked out in many, easier ways, if Merck and the small group of community people who were involved in the entire development process, had acted a little earlier than two weeks before the drug was bottled up and sent out to PWAs. The people who will bear the brunt of this ugly situation are the many PWAs who need this drug the most right now: people who have outlived other antivirals, have lower T cells or high viral loads. They may not receive this drug for months and months, if ever. The vast majority of PWAs have no experience using mail order pharmacies, and if the paper trail extends too far, many doctors will be less willing to prescribe the drug-disgusting, but true. People who want Crixivan now and are unable to get it should be angry at Merck for devising this labyrinth of hooey, and should be angry at their activist community reps for not calling them on it sooner. </p>

<p>(Since this was written Merck has decided to provide Crixivan directly to the VA system, Federal Prison system, as well as Kaiser and some smaller HMOs. Merck has also promised enough drug for 15,000 PWAs, in France, by September, even though they confirmed on April 1, that they have Crixivan for only 30,000 PWAs worldwide, until their factory opens. Community Prescription Service and MediExpress will assist people with the paper work from Stadtlanders for access to Crixivan.)</p>

<p>In his Welcome-To-Stadtlanders letter, Gregg Perelman, President of Stadtlanders, writes: "We know there can be numerous obstacles for individuals who are living with challenging health conditions. When winds blow softly or the storms rage violently, we hope that the foundation of patient support we create at Stadtlanders can help to keep our customers grounded in a safe place." </p>

<p>Safe for whom? STADTLANDERS... Friend of the Community and PRICE GOUGER!!</p>

<p><a name="price">For</a> the FDA approved Crixivan dose of 2,400 mg/day, Merck charges Stadtlanders: $12/day or $4,380/year</p>

<p>Stadtlanders charges you: $16.50/day or $6,022/year</p>

<p>THAT’S AN OUTRAGEOUS 37.5% MARKUP!</p>

<p>Stadtlanders reps claim that their price is only 10% above the average wholesale price ("AWP"). BUT THERE IS NO WHOLESALE PRICE. Stadtlanders is buying Crixivan directly from Merck. No wholesaler is involved. And, of course, no competition either.</p>

<p>Merck estimates that they can supply 30,000 people until next fall. If so, Stadtlanders’ gross profit in six months will hypothetically be: 24.3 million dollars! Stadtlanders whines that they have had to hire 420 new employees! And that it’s really just their usual, higher than average markup! Ahh, the joys of monopoly distribution. Remember that they don’t have a monopoly on anything else, vitamins or 3TC or Fosarnet. Get Crixivan at Stadtlanders and everything else anywhere else, preferably a place that really supports PWAs.</p>

<P>Hopefully, by the time you read this Stadtlanders will have done the right thing and lowered their price. But meanwhile, TAKE ACTION! Call and/or fax Stadtlanders, the "friend of the community." Rainbow flags are not enough! </p>

<p><b><a name="new">NEW</a> PRODUCTS? WHAT NEW PRODUCTS?</b><br>
<i>by Andy Young</i></p>

<p>The New Products Committee, which is made up of PWAs and doctors from our Board of Directors, met last month to discuss possible new products for the PWA Health Group. I had never attended one of these meetings and found it to be an interesting process¾something that sets the Health Group apart from other buyers’ clubs. First, I compiled data, as much as there was, for the four things we were to consider: <a href="#cat's">Cat’s Claw</a>, <a href="#thymo">Thymopentin</a>, <a href="#cantha">Cantharadin</a>, and <a href="#nita">Nitazoxanide</a>. For a product to get approved by our Board, it has to be safe to take, not cost too much, and, a fact that is sometimes overlooked, it has to do some good. Side effects are defined in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>short term side effects -- does it make you throw up?
<li>longer term effects -- what does it do to your liver? and third, <li>effects on HIV progression, ie, can it speed up HIV replication in any way?
</ul>

<p><b><a name="cat's">Cat’s</a> Claw</b> has interested us because it’s so popular with PWAs, and because of the anecdotal data that it is a strong antiviral, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-etc., herbal compound. Part of our mission is to listen to and respond to the community’s voice and treatment decisions. Cat’s Claw is an herbal product derived from the Peruvian root, Uncaria Tormentosa. A European version called Krallendorn is prescribed as if it were a pharmaceutical, in Germany at least, but there was no data available to back up claims made by the various marketeers who want to sell it in the US. After repeated requests, the Austrian company, Immodal, gave me reports based on one, two, six patients who took Krallendorn and said they felt better. This did not make the committee, or myself, feel any better about selling this product. The problem, as I see it, is that anyone can sell almost anything and call it Cat’s Claw without having to prove what it is to anyone. Immodal was more than happy to send me info that their product had less wood pulp and no fungus in it, unlike their competitors, but they wouldn’t provide us with any information that it does anything for PWAs who take it. The committee rejected it.</p>

<p><b><a name="thymo">Thymopentin</a></b> is studied clinically in the US and is available in Italy and Germany. It’s an injectable extract based on hormones found in the thymus, the gland where T cells are produced. One reason for interest in this drug is that we may lose our Italian source for Thymosin alpha-1, another ‘thymus-stimulator’, with proven activity against chronic Hepatitis B infection. A decision on thymopentin was put on hold because at the last minute we found out that we may be able to get Thymosin alpha-1 in Singapore. Results of Thymopentin trials are encouraging, in that people who used thymopentin with AZT had fewer problems with opportunistic infections and better sustained T cell levels than those who took AZT alone, and there don’t seem to be any side effects. It’s also very expensive.</p>

<p><b><a name="cantha">Cantharadin</a></b> is the poison from a bug called the Blister Beetle. The extract burns the skin and has been in Chinese medicine for centuries to treat warts and other skin problems. It used to be available as an ointment in the US, and was used in the sixties to treat Molluscum Contagiosum in infants. The many dermatologists I spoke with said, ‘Oh, yeah. I remember that. It was just pulled from the market...I don’t know why.’ We think we can get it from Canada, to help people treat Molluscum less painfully than the endless freezing and scraping. The committee was a bit worried about Cantharadin, because in searching for info, I found many references to people who have been blinded, had heart attacks, and gotten burned terribly by swallowing the dreaded Blister Beetle. Of course this was the fault of the beetle itself, not an ointment that is 5% extract and 95% goo. But it is worth considering, huh? It also seems that some people have sold this extract as ‘Spanish Fly’- an aphrodiasiac (thank you Medline). Anyway, it’s all pretty weird, but once we have a supply, we’ll start providing it to people with a prescription, for treating Molluscum. </p>

<p><b><a name="nita">Nitazoxanide</a></b> was discussed in the last issue of Notes as a promising treatment for the treatment of Cryptosporidia and Microsporidia. There is no effective treatment approved by the FDA for these killers, so if we could get our grubby little hands on the drug, we’d sell it in a jiffy. The problem with Nitazoxanide is that it is seemingly not for sale anywhere in the world...a significant problem. Some believe that it’s an approved vet drug in Europe, but the French veterinarian I spoke to said it had been approved, but never sold. The chief researcher at the company in the US told me that I would be "sorely disappointed" if we tried to import this drug. The committee voted that we should aggressively work to get NTZ ASAP.</p>

Hello!!! When do we eat????</font></td><td><font size=-1>Poorly tolerated...2 out of 5 people who took Norvir and AZT dropped out of the study. 1 out of 3 who took Norvir, AZT, and ddC dropped out.

Some patients felt nauseous, weak, and had stomach pain when they took Invirase and AZT or ddC, but combination therapy is preferred. Resistance problems seem to be less with combo therapy.

<p><b><a name="mac">HOLD</a> THE BIG MAC</b><br><i>by Andy Young</i></p>

<p>Protease hoo-hah aside, the Retrovirus Conference at the end of January gave PWAs and doctors a lot of information about <a href="../../network/simple/mac.html">MAC</a> (mycobacterium avium complex) prevention in the form of two large prevention studies. MAC is a bacterial infection that can cause a variety of symptoms and is difficult to diagnose. People with an active infection often run fevers, lose weight, and have no appetite, and the bacteria can be present in almost any part of the body. Two large trials compared MAC treatments and prevention regimens.</p>

<p>These two studies are important, because many PWAs with less than 100 T cells take <a href="../../network/access/drugs/rifa.html">Rifabutin</a> to prevent MAC. (Rifabutin use has to be stopped or the dosage changed when used with protease inhibitors.) Rifabutin is currently the only drug approved by the FDA for the prevention of MAC.</p>

<p>In one study, 1200 patients with less than 100 T cells took Rifabutin, <a href="../../network/access/drugs/clar.html">Clarithromycin</a>, or both. 9% of patients who took Clarithromycin developed MAC, 15% of those on Rifabutin, and 7% on the combo...not very big differences (in terms of statistical significance). The key finding was that almost 30% of people who took Clarithromycin alone or in the combo developed resistance to it. Clarithromycin is the standard treatment for active MAC infections. Resistance to it before a person actually becomes sick with the monster is way bad news.</p>

<p>The other large trial looked at 699 PWAs on Rifabutin, <a href="../../network/access/drugs/azit.html">Azithromycin</a> or both in combination. The combination was again the best preventative treatment. 2.5% of PWAs who took Azithromycin and Rifabutin together got MAC, compared to 8.8% who used Azithromycin alone, and 11.6% who took only Rifabutin. One scary thing is that 11% of people who developed active MAC infections in this study became resistant to both Azithromycin and Clarithromycin. This happens because the two drugs are so similar in chemical structure that resistance to one can be functionally resistant to both. Cross resistance between Azithromycin and Clarithromycin would leave Rifabutin alone as the treatment for an active MAC infection.</p>

<p>These studies tell us that there are other and possibly more effective ways to prevent MAC than just taking Rifabutin alone. The successful use of Azithromycin is really interesting because it only was taken once a week. A potential problem is cross resistance between Azithromycin and Clarithromycin, which also spells trouble in treating an active MAC infection. People do not develop resistance to Rifabutin from taking it, or from the other drugs discussed here, but it was shown in both studies to be the least succesful way to avoid a MAC infection.</p>

<p>As a footnote, <a href="../info/roxi.html">Roxithromycin</a>, another antibiotic in the same family as Azithromycin and Clarithromycin, that we carry here, has also been shown to work as MAC prevention and as a treatment for cryptosporidiosis. Treatment and prevention for MAC is a dicey proposition at best. All the medicines are strong and can be difficult to take, both physically and in regards to which other medicines have to be avoided. But truth be told, I’d rather make my doctor work to figure out which drugs of many I should use, than have no options to choose from.</p>

<p><i>The next piece was written by a friend of mine, who lives in New York City. It is the first of an ongoing series which looks at the treatment decisions people make. If you would like to contribute, call <a href="mailto:pwahg@aidsnyc.org">Andy</a>. Thanks in advance. </i></p>

<p><b><a name="decisions">DECISIONS</a>, DECISIONS</b><br><i>by Horacio Tintos</i></p>

<p>I decided out of curiosity in, February, 1995, to participate in an HIV testing program for gay men. I knew that those who were negative stayed in the program, and those who were positive were sent to other places to get help. The day that I got the results, I left with three pounds of paper, pamphlets, folders...all of which told me ‘you are not alone.’ Besides that, they all gave me a million instructions about legal, medical, psychological, and nutritional things. I was a wreck, alone in the US without family or anyone I was close to share the news. I was afraid of the future which seemed completely black. I was an undocumented immigrant without any health insurance, and a job where I barely got paid. What did I expect? The worst. In spite of that I decided to stay in the fight and do all that I could for myself.</p>

<p>Because of hospital bureaucracy, I couldn’t get a medical appointment until April, but I had an appointment with a social worker two days after I got my results, and got my blood drawn for my first T cell count. There was basically enough time before my first appointment to memorize all the information the program had given me, so I decided to learn what was known about the illness.</p>

<p>First, I decide to make my life last as long as possible. I’m not going to fall apart or kill myself because I have a virus in my blood. Secondly, I am infected, but don’t want to be reinfected. I need to take care of myself. But more than anything, I don’t want to ever infect or give this to another human being; no one deserves to carry this kind of load. Thirdly, I need to help myself in all aspects of my life - emotional, physical, economical, and social, to try to continue my life happily. It’s a big challenge, but I resolved to know how to deal with and overcome every problem that comes with the development of this disease. Since February, 1995, when I learned I was HIV positive, I decided to do all that I can to strengthen my immune system. I changed the way I ate, since it was such a disaster, so I ate as much fruit, vegetables, and cereal as I could. The binges when I would drink and stay up all night were gone. Resolute in my decisions, I started taking Cat’s Claw and shark cartilage. I knew perfectly well that they were neither going to kill the virus, nor even slow down the illness. I had heard that they help the immune system. I had faith that it would strengthen my immune system, so I did it not wanting to give the virus the opportunity or room to advance quickly.</p>

<p>In the following months I felt well and my T4 cells were around 430, but the doctor told me that something strange was in my blood, and I would have to redo all the tests. Later, he told me that I had two other infections in my body, and then I got red sores on my skin that bothered me when I walked. The solution to this problem was 2.4 million units of penicillin for three weeks.</p>

<p>May was the worst; I was so tired all the time, and I lost fourteen pounds. Besides, they had taken fluid from my spinal cord to see if the infection had affected my brain. I had begun to walk more slowly and my balance was off. Because I was so nervous, my immune system was fighting against HIV and the other two infections, and I was taking so many antibiotics, my T cell count went down terribly, to around 200. The doctor told me that we shouldn’t lose any more time. He said that it was imperative to start to take pharmaceutical medications. I had told him earlier that I would not take antivirals.</p>

<p>I perfectly remember that morning in the hospital when I had a long, serious talk with my doctor about the medicines he wanted me to start taking. The decision was to take <a href="../../network/simple/combo.html">AZT with 3TC</a>, because, as he explained, they had been shown to block or slow down the virus, and in the best cases, raise T4 counts. I felt like a marionette, slowly nodding my head whenever I thought I should, acting like I knew why my doctor was being so adamant. For the first week I only took AZT, three times a day. I was told to take it alone so my body could get used to it, and to begin 3TC later.</p>

<p>I also had to take Bactrim as a prevention against a bunch of respiratory problems that are common and devastating for HIV positive people. He told me that a high percentage of the people’s bodies reject Bactrim, for reasons that were not understood. "If you seem to have an allergy to it, stop taking it and we’ll find something else that you can take."</p>

<p>Since the first week of taking AZT, I felt like I had poured Drano into my stomach. My stomach was swollen, I was nauseous, I was sweating all the time, and I had headaches. Even so, I continued taking it for a month because I thought I would learn to deal with the side effects. I tried alternating Bactrim and 3TC, in an attempt to find out which of the two medicines was giving me the side effects. Incredibly, I had no problem taking Bactrim; no allergy to Bactrim and no side effects with 3TC.</p>

<p>By the fifth week of taking AZT and 3TC, my body couldn’t handle it any more - I had lost more weight, didn’t have an appetite, my stomach hurt all the time, I had chills, my body ached, and to top it off, I had a headache 24 hours a day. I spoke to my doctor again who told me we should half the dose of AZT, which I did for another week. I felt so physically and emotionally bad because I had put an iron faith into the combination. I only ever had heard about combinations of AZT and another antiviral. I was devastated, psychologically destroyed because some of my friends and some of my support group had or were taking AZT without any consequences. Why wouldn’t my body accept it? On top of it all, my T4 cells had dropped to around 100. </p>

<p>After another appointment with my doctor, we opted to completely stop AZT. Although the combination of Zerit and 3TC was not very well studied, the results have been fabulous for me. I have no side effects right now. I feel perfectly well, have gained all my weight back, my other infections have disappeared, and magically, my T4 cells, which were racing downward, are increasing with each test. I still take the Cat’s Claw and shark cartilage; if they are not helping me, they are at least not hurting me. </p>

<p>I now believe that it is important to take the antivirals even though they cannot cure a person with HIV, they can extend how long they live. I am also staying with the natural therapies that I take because I belive that they are helpful to how my body functions: how it cleans out the bad things, how it even out the functioning of my body. I think that both things have the highest importance in my body.</p>

<p><b><a name="alright">ALRIGHT</a> THYMOSIN!!</b><br><i>by Andy Young</i></p>

<p>Happily (for novelty’s sake), the PWA Health Group reports that a product we carry, <a href="../info/thym.html">Thymosin- alpha-1</a>, has emerged victorious in a scientific brawl with the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). In an actual controlled, randomized study with 158 patients in Taiwan, preliminary results show that 38.5% of people who injected 1.6 mg Thymosin-alpha-1, twice a week, for six months, got rid of HBV (<a href="../../network/simple/viral.html">viral load</a>, as examined through branched DNA PCR) and antigen to HBV, which measures the amount of viral replication. Liver enzyme values also came back down to normal.</p>

<p>The team at good old Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, in Taipei, also reported that 33.3% of people with chronic HBV infection who injected the drug for a full year, were clear. This was still the case after a year and half. This study is ongoing and data will be released this summer.</p>

<p>This is great news because there is no more effective-looking treatment available, anywhere, anyhow. Unfortunately, this drug is way, way expensive. If you were to take 2.6 mg twice a week, Thymosin-alpha-1, would cost you $520 each month. There aren’t any side effects, as opposed to the standard chronic HBV treatment, alpha-interferon, and Thymosin is up for approval in seven countries (not the US) to treat HBV. </p>

<p>The US company that is developing and seeking approval for Thymosin, Sci-Clone , is also studying the drug for use in chronic hepatitis C, and HIV infection. So, we’ll have to see what happens this summer, and don’t forget to keep your eyes on 3TC. The successful use of 3TC and alpha- interferon in chronic HBV was discussed in <a href="31.html#3tc">Notes 31</a>.</p>

<p>In the community, peer workers train and work in similar programs, though they will have more varied opportunities.  They will focus on reaching substance users in street, treatment, and other community settings as well as through peer networks.</p>

<p >"We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give" -Winston Churchill.</p> <p align=center> <b>Now look at what some of our volunteers have to say about volunteering:</b></p>
<p>"For me, offering support to those in need is an excellent way of contributing to the community.  I walk away with a feeling of self gratification each time I visit someone because I know that I have made a positive impact on someone's life that day." - Donna G.</p>
<p>"I feel upligted when I volunteer, to do all I can to help those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS has really changed my life perspective" - Anthony C.</p>
<p>:I have lost my best friend and someone in my family which has been very painful for me.  Volunteering has enabled me to recognize my feelings and helped me to speak about feelings that I've have been holding on to." - Raymond A.</p>
<p>"Since I've been volunteering I've found it very heartwarming to see the Staten Island AIDS Task Force help people help themselves and I have the feeling that I should help an organization that will probably help me in the future." - Mick</p>
<p>"Pain has a weird effect on people.  It makes them cry, it makes them angry, but sometimes it draws them closer to the source.  By volunteering I have acknowledged my pain and regained strength by my dedication and commitment to helping others>" - Virginia</p>
<p>"Caringness and love is what I provide through my volunteerism.  To take on the responsibility of helping others is powerful and I am happy to say that I am a part of the Task Force's 'community of caring'" - Lillian</p>
<p>I knew I didn't have large sums of money to carry out philanthropic work or extensive medical knowledge to go out and do research, so I decided that I could make a difference by becoming an active volunteer.  After all education is a primary means of ending this epidemic." - Cary</p>
<p>Being at the crossroads of my life right now, I have always liked helping people, whather children or adults in what ever way that I could.  It's my calling to be where I am needed without any fanfare." - Annette</p>

<title>ACT UP: Real Treatments for Real People</title>

<h3>About the Index</h3>

<p><font size=2>This is an interim version of an overview of what is out there–then you can do more investigating! I realize the terminology may be dense–it's the only way to get this much information in so little space. If you have a question about a word, don't be put off–there are a number of sources you can go to (including medical dictionaries like Dorland's, Stedman's or Taber's, treatment activists, your healthcare provider, etc.) If you have questions, contacts, suggestions, updates, insights, etc., please contact me at (212) 673-2531.You can send e-mail to <a href="mailto:gmc0@ix.netcom.com"></a>gmc0@ix.netcom.com</a>. PARTICULAR HELP IS SOUGHT FOR CHANGES IN TELEPHONE <a href="numbers.html">NUMBERS/CONTACT ADDRESSES</a> LISTED HERE!</font></p>

<p><font size=2>Unfortunately, many of the items listed herein are not in any clinical trial or are not covered by many medical plans. Access is therefore a problem. One activist effort ACT UP is engaged in is endeavoring to force the National Institutes of Health (NIH) out of their stodgy, narrow-minded and arrogant attitudes into assessing what people are doing in a meaningful way. This is called the REAL TREATMENTS FOR REAL PEOPLE CAMPAIGN. Assessing therapies tells us if what people are doing is helping or not–or hurting. And if helping, to get an idea on the strengths, limitations, problems, dosing, scheduling and other types of questions that help achieve the maximum benefit. In addition, if NIH performs these studies and shows efficacy, it may open physicians' minds to use of such ignored options while driving public policy (insurance companies, Medicaid, etc.) to cover them.</font><p>

<p><font size=2>The first issue is what to study. There are many anecdotal reports, scientific evidence and other rationales for reviewing a variety of alternatives. Some of these include anabolic steroids, combinations of micronutrients, hyperforat, combination antioxidant therapy, DNCB, glycyrrhizin, transfer factors, combination thymic extracts, curcumin, colloidal silver (as an antimicrobial), Chinese and other herbs, bitter melon (not just the MAP 30 extract–which still hasn't been evaluated) and so forth. There are many others. Input from the community should be the driving force in prioritizing which are most deserving of attention, not just the stultified, arrogant and blind peer review system currently extant at NIH.</font></p>

<p><font size=2>Aside from the fact that many of these are unpatentable (and hence unprofitable), there is a prejudice by mainstream researchers against "complementary" approaches. This is institutional orthodoxy that flies in the face of the basic tenets of science. This anti-scientific attitude pervades the FDA, NIH, mainstream medical practice, the International AIDS Society (the people who put on the big AIDS conventions), which almost completely exclude analysis or discussion of these approaches. That is where activists must raise BLOODY HELL. There is some good news: the 1996 Vancouver conference may be MUCH better at not just welcoming but fostering a broader perspective. Unfortunately, for Americans, any foreign research on alternatives is ignored: there is an America-Only policy that prohibits use of foreign trials as basis for approval. Such arrogance!!</font></p>

<p><font size=2>After determining what to look at, the next questions is how. Methodology has been limited by and large to standard trial design. While this is useful in a limited way, it is not the only way to develop meaningful, life saving information. Broadly speaking, two general approaches can be simultaneously pursued: the broad assessments and the narrow focus. The broad area are the different ways to assess the reality of people doing a wide range of therapies which change over time, following this evolution (e.g., management trials). I have been in touch with Carlton Hogan of the Minneapolis CPCRA who, with others, has developed an approach to clinical trial design called MAPS (Master Antiretroviral Protocol Strategy). It addresses the question of how to strategize trials to deal with individuals' unique needs through stratification and shifting protocols. They seek to use it not just for "nukes" but also for alternative & complementary protocols, OI protocols, etc. This is a type of management trial that reflects real world behavior while providing information on efficacy.</font><p>

<p><font size=2>In parallel with this should be smaller, shorter studies that can assess anticipated impact of therapies on blood work (e.g,. effect on viral load of antivirals; effect on oxidative stress markers for antioxidants, etc.) With a large and small view working in tandem, a clearer picture may arise as to what works and what the limitations are. This description, of course, only outlines the broad strokes of such ideas; but the possibilities may well help us to understand how to deal with HIV infection in a comprehensive, integrative fashion.</font></p>

<p><font size=2>Aside from clinical questions, the other major component of AIDS is the basic science or "pathogenesis": the events that occur in bodies after HIV infection that result in AIDS. The ACT UP/New York Demand for a McClintock Project to Cure AIDS has become the AIDS Cure Act and has been introduced by Gerald Nadler (D-NY) in the House of Representatives. This is an ambitious and detailed program for a "Manhattan Project" which Clinton supported, but–consistent with his litany of betrayals–is doing nothing about. The Project is a vigorous program to study the pathogenesis of AIDS–what causes the immune system to dysregulate–so that rational approaches can be developed. This is vital given NIH's long history of ignoring vital areas of AIDS research like oxidative stress. For background reading material, please see the text of the bill. We used the word "cure" which is defined as "Any and all approaches which will ensure a well-functioning immune system (including but not limited to antiretrovirals, curative vaccines and immune regulators) and a normal life span with a reasonable quality of life."</font></p>

<p><font size=2>You might also review Griffin, MT, "AIDS and the Pharmaceutical Industry:  A Need for Reform," American Journal of Law and Medicine, (1991) 17(4):363-410. For copies, contact ACT UP/NY at the address on page 1. This is just scratching the surface of what is wrong and why serious changes need to be made. Profit is one thing, but when it is at the expense of peoples' lives and causes unnecessary suffering, it is not an acceptable single criterion for business!</font></p>

<p><font size=2>The work is enormous. It will take input from everyone. I am interested only in what works, not what label it is given. I often wind up stressing so-called alternative approaches because 1) there are few voices calling for their rigorous assessment and 2) the industries that produce them are unable (due to lack of funds), unwilling (just greedy) and/or untrained (in clinical methodology) to undertake these efforts. There is a great deal of lies, hype and false hope generated by both alternatives AND mainstream medical researchers and practitioners. And there is a treasure trove of value in each. We must seek to end these artificial distinctions by calling for rigorous science rooted in the only valuable perspective: that which improves and heals people. Undoubtedly, this will require practitioners from every field to expand their horizons and go beyond the narrow confines of their respective training.</font></p>

<P><font size=2>These indices are still incomplete–and will remain so until the end of the AIDS crisis!  If you have any questions, comments, corrections, additions, deletions, etc., please do not hesitate to contact me at 212-673-2531. Please feel free to copy and distribute it! But don't sell it and do not include it in publications without permission.</font></p>

<p><font size=2>Source material for the Indexes is noted where possible. Sources include but are not limited to the wide range of AIDS-related newsletters (see last page), peer-reviewed and other journals, pharmaceutical company and government information and, where there is a fair amount, anecdotal information (which is noted). Background information also from various texts on disease, pharmacology and immunology. Thanks to the New York Academy of Medicine for their great help in providing resource material. A considerable amount of information is available (and used herein) from computer networks, notably AEGIS (San Juan Capistrano, CA), HIVNET (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and The Backroom's Talking About AIDS (New York). See the last page for a more complete (but not exhaustive) listing with modem telephone numbers. An incredibly BIG IMMENSE HUG of gratitude to Lark Lands for re-writing the nutrition section, her invaluable support, insights, help and expertise through out; so plug #2 for her forthcoming book, Positively Well:  Living with HIV as a Chronic, Manageable, Survivable Disease by Lark Lands: Available late summer! Order: 1-800-542-8102, outside North America or in Toronto, Ontario, Canada call 905-672-7470.</font></p>

<title>&#191;Qu&eacute; es La RED?</title>
</head>

<body background="../gifs/blue_pap.gif" text="#000000">

<h1 align=center>&#191;Qu&eacute; es <a href="index.html">La RED</a>?</h1>
<h3 align=center>Ll&aacute;menos al 1 (800) 734-7104</h3>

<p>La RED de Informaci&oacute;n sobre el SIDA es el programa en espa&ntilde;ol del <a href="../index.html">AIDS Treatment Data Network</a>. La RED es una organizaci&oacute;n independiente, nacional y sin fines de lucro que ofrece informaci&oacute;n sobre tratamientos aprobados, experimentales y alternativos contra el VIH/SIDA. Tambi&eacute;n ofrecemos consejer&iacute;a y apoyo individual para que las personas que necesitan estos tratamientos puedan tener acceso a ellos. La RED no es un grupo que desarolla pol&iacute;ticas sobre el SIDA o un grupo activista. Para formar parte de La RED, solamente tienes que llamarnos. La RED no promueve o vende ning&uacute;n medicamento o producto. &Eacute;sto asegura nuestra objetividad al ofrecer informaci&oacute;n y servicios. Toda la informaci&oacute;n que recibimos de individuos u organizaciones es completamente confidencial. Si Ud. quiere utilizar nuestros recursos, ll&aacute;menos al (800) 734-7104.</p>

<h3>Consejer&iacute;a sobre Tratamientos</h3>

<p>La RED ofrece informaci&oacute;n sobre el SIDA, f&aacute;cil de comprender, a todas las personas interesadas. Tambi&eacute;n proveemos referidos y consejer&iacute;a sobre estudios experimentales u otros programas de tratamientos contra el VIH/SIDA. Nosotros env&iacute;amos, por correo, facs&iacute;mil o computadora, descripciones de tratamientos contra el VIH/SIDA, as&iacute; como informaci&oacute;n sobre complicaciones asociadas al VIH/SIDA. &Eacute;ste es un servicio nacional.</p>

<h3>Informaci&oacute;n sobre Tratamientos</h3>

<p>La RED obtiene informaci&oacute;n muy importante de varias fuentes, y las publica en una manera sencilla. La <a href="resena/index.html">Rese&ntilde;a de Tratamientos</a> es un folleto publicado cuatros veces al a&ntilde;o y contiene art&iacute;culos sobre tratamientos experimentales y alternativos contra el VIH/SIDA. La Gu&iacute;a de Tratamientos Experimentales es el directorio de estudios cl&iacute;ncios y programas de tratamientos llevados a cabo en el &aacute;rea metropolitana de Nueva York. <a href="deberia.html">&#191;Deber&iacute;a Yo Participar en un Estudio Cl&iacute;nico?</a> es un panfleto env&iacute;ado junto a La Gu&iacute;a, &eacute;ste contiene preguntas importantes en las que debemos pensar antes de decidir participar o no en un estudio cl&iacute;nico. Si quiere recibir nuestras publicaciones o si desea mayor informaci&oacute;n, anote su nombre y direcci&oacute;n en el espacio provisto adelante.</p>

<p>La RED recibe fondos del gobierno, industria privada, fundaciones e individuos. Desafortunadamente, obtener los fondos que necesitamos es dif&iacute;cil y muchas veces no cubren todos nuestros gastos. Cualquier donaci&oacute;n individual o de organizaciones siempre ser&aacute;n muy apreciadas. Favor de considerar una donaci&oacute;n de cualquier cantidad para apoyar nuestro esfuerzo. ¡Gracias!</p>

<h3><a name="entendiendo">Entendiendo</a> los Estudios Cl&iacute;nicos</h3>

<p>&#191; Qu&eacute; es un estudio cl&iacute;nico? &#191; Por qu&eacute; son realizados los estudios cl&iacute;nicos? &#191; Por qu&eacute; no puedo tomar solamente el medicamento que quiero? &#191; Qu&eacute; tipo de medicamentos est&aacuten siendo estudiados? &#191; Sabr&eacute; cu&aacutel medicamento estoy tomando? &#191; Tomar&eacute; el placebo? &#191; Por qu&eacute; voy a querer participar en un estudio? &#191; Qu&eacute; m&aacutes deber&iacute;a saber? &#191; Qu&eacute; es un estudio de medicamentos?</p>

<p>Un estudio de medicamentos es un experimento cuidadosamente controlado. Quienes participan toman una medicina para probar si &eacute;sta es segura y si funciona. Los estudios de medicamentos tambi&eacute;n son llamados estudios o pruebas cl&iacute;nicas.</p>

<p>No se saben cuales son los efectos de los medicamentos investigados en estudios cl&iacute;nicos. Es muy importante saber cuales son los riesgos y los beneficios de participar en un estudio cl&iacute;nico. Cada estudio es diferente, por eso, es importante saber de que se tratan y que se puede esperar antes de formar parte del mismo.</p>

<p>&#191; Por qu&eacute; son realizados los estudios cl&iacute;nicos?</p>

<p>No hay muchos medicamentos aprobados que combaten el VIH/SIDA, aunque hay ciertos medicamentos que pueden ser efectivos. Los estudios cl&iacute;nicos se realizan para determinar cuales medicamentos son efectivos y cuales no. Si las compa&ntilde&iacute;as vendieran medicamentos sin probar sus efectos,la informaci&oacute;n vendr&iacute;a a trav&eacute;s de los fabricantes del medicamento o de historias no confirmadas. En otras palabras, estos medicamentos ser&iacute;an promovidos o vendidos sin comprobar los efectos, o lo seguro que puedan ser.</p>

<p>&#191; Por qu&eacute; no puedo tomar solamente el medicamento que quiero?</p>

<p>Cada medicamento en venta en los Estados Unidos debe ser primero aprobado por la FDA (Administraci&oacute;n de Alimentos y Medicamentos). La FDA revisa cuidadosamente la informaci&oacute;n obtenida de los estudios cl&iacute;nicos para determinar si el medicamento es seguro y trabaja adecuadamente. Si es seguro y efectivo, la FDA aprueba la venta del medicamento a la compa&ntilde&iacute;a farmace&uacute;tica. Vender medicamentos no aprobados por la FDA es ilegal. Las compa&ntilde&iacute;as de seguros, Medicaid, Medicare o el Programa de Asistencia sobre Medicamentos contra el SIDA (ADAP, usualmente no cubren el costo de un medicamento o tratamiento no revisado y aprobado por la FDA.</p>

<p>Fase I: &#191; Es el medicamento seguro?</p>

<p>Usualmente, en un estudio de Fase I, es la primera vez que un nuevo medicamento es dado a personas. Este tipo de estudio es realizado para ver si es seguro tomar el medicamento. Todos los participantes en un estudio de Fase I toman cierta cantidad del medicamento, aunque tambi&eacute;n reciben diferentes dosis del mismo para ver cual es la m&aacutes adecuada. Los medicamentos en Fase I no han sido probados en seres humanos, por lo que hay poca informaci&oacute;n sobre ellos. Esto hace que los estudios de Fase I sean de mayor riesgo que los estudios de Fase II &oacute; III. Los estudios de Fase I son cortos, usualmente duran de 2 a 3 meses y participan cerca de 100 personas. En los estudios de Fase I se suele estudiar cuan seguro es un medicamento, aunque tambi&eacute;n estudian c&oacute;mo el medicamento afecta al cuerpo.</p>

<p>Fase II: &#191; Es efectivo?</p>

<p>Si en un estudio de Fase I se encuentra que el medicamento es suficientemente seguro, el estudio pasa a una segunda fase (Fase II). En un estudio de Fase II m&aacutes personas reciben el medicamento para ver si &eacute;ste es efectivo y estudiar los efectos secundarios m&aacutes cuidadosamente. En este tipo de estudio los investigadores tratan de probar si el medicamento tiene un buen efecto. Los estudios de Fase II duran desde unos pocos meses hasta a&ntildeos y pueden haber cientos de participantes. En los estudios de Fase II todav&iacute;a existen riesgos, as&iacute; como posibles beneficios.</p>

<p>Fase III: &#191; Qu&eacute; ocurre si es tomado por muchas personas?</p>

<p>Si en la Fase II se encuentra que el medicamento puede ser efectivo, se pasa a la Fase III. En este tipo de estudio, muchas personas, algunas veces miles, toman el medicamento para ver cuan bien trabaja. Los investigadores buscan efectos secundarios poco comunes, que generalmente son vistos en pocas personas. Medicamentos contra enfermedades graves, tal como el SIDA, pueden ser aprobados despu&eacute;s de pasar la Fase II. Se espera que la compa&ntilde&iacute;a que compra el medicamento realice el estudio de Fase III, despu&eacute;s que el medicamento est&eacute; aprobado. Algunas veces, las diferentes fases est&aacuten combinadas, por lo que usted podr&aacute ver un estudio descrito como Fase I/II &oacute; Fase II/III. Esto permite que algunos medicamentos sean estudiados m&aacutes r&aacutepidamente.</p>

<p>&#191; Sabr&eacute; cu&aacutel medicamento estoy tomando?</p>

<p>No siempre. En un estudio de Fase I, Ud. sabr&aacute el medicamento que est&aacute tomando y la cantidad o dosis de &eacute;ste. En estudios de Fase II &oacute; III, tal vez no. Usualmente, los estudios de Fase II &oacute; III son estudios controlados. Los participantes en estos estudios son divididos al azar en diferentes grupos. Cada grupo toma o el nuevo medicamento, o el medicamento aprobado o el placebo.</p>

<p>Los grupos que toman el medicamento aprobado o el placebo se llaman grupos "control". Generalmente nadie, ni las personas que est&aacuten llevando a cabo el estudio saben qui&eacute;n est&aacute tomando qu&eacute; hasta que termina el estudio. Esto es lo que se conoce como un estudio Doble-Ciego. Si todos saben el medicamento que cada cual est&aacute tomando, el estudio es conocido como un estudio de Etiqueta-Abierta.</p>

<p>Un placebo es una pastilla o inyecci&oacute;n que se parece al medicamento bajo investigaci&oacute;n, pero no tiene medicina. En los estudios son utilizados placebos para que los investigadores puedan estar seguros de que los beneficios o efectos secundarios experimentados, se deben al medicamento y no a otra causa.</p>

<p>Los estudios controlados son hechos para ver si el medicamento de verdad es efectivo. Si todos los participantes en el estudio toman el nuevo medicamento, no habr&aacute forma de probar que el medicamento les est&aacute haciendo sentir mejor, o si se debe a otra causa. Puede ser que se mejoren porque est&aacuten viendo a su doctor por primera vez, porque est&aacuten comiendo mejor o porque se est&aacuten cuidando m&aacutes. Por &eacute;sto, un nuevo medicamento es comparado con otro o con un placebo, para ver cual funciona mejor.</p>

<p>&#191; Tomar&eacute; el placebo?</p>

<p>Depende del estudio. Puede ser que usted tome solamente el placebo si no existen tratamientos aprobados. Si en un estudio se est&aacute probando un medicamento contra la infecci&oacute;n oportunista llamada criptosporidiosis, algunas personas solamente tomar&aacuten el placebo porque no existe un tratamiento aprobado contra la criptosporidiosis. Pero &eacute;sto no pasar&iacute;a si existiera un tratamiento aprobado contra su condici&oacute;n. Si as&iacute; fuera, usted podr&iacute;a tomar el nuevo medicamento o el medicamento aprobado.</p>

<p>En algunos estudios son investigados medicamentos para ver si pueden prevenir enfermedades. En estos estudios, algunas personas podr&iacute;an recibir solamente el placebo. Debido a que actualmente, algunos medicamentos est&aacuten siendo estudiados en combinaci&oacute;n, una o m&aacutes p&iacute;ldoras, o inyecciones en el estudio, podr&iacute;an ser un placebo. Por ejemplo, un grupo podr&iacute;a tomar el nuevo medicamento y AZT. El otro grupo tomar&iacute;a el placebo y AZT. Si est&aacute pensando formar parte de un estudio en el que podr&iacute;a recibir el placebo, pregunte si podr&aacute recibir el tratamiento despu&eacute;s que termine el estudio. De todas formas, esto no significa que el nuevo medicamento ser&aacute efectivo.</p>

<p>Si los participantes en el estudio creen que est&aacuten tomando un medicamento que funciona, podr&iacute;an sentirse mejor aunque el medicamento no funcione. Por ejemplo, en un estudio hecho para tratar la diarrea, la mitad de los participantes que tomaron el medicamento se mejoraron. Casi la otra mitad de los participantes que tomaron el placebo tambi&eacute;n se mejoraron. Esto mostr&oacute; que el medicamento no funcion&oacute; mucho mejor que la p&iacute;ldora az&uacute;car (placebo). Al lado izquierdo de esta p&aacutegina aparece una lista de las razones por las que usted deber&iacute;a participar en un estudio cl&iacute;nico.</p>

<p>&#191; Por qu&eacute; participar&iacute;a en un estudio cl&iacute;nico?</p>

<p>Participar en un estudio de un medicamento experimental es una decisi&oacute;n muy seria. Hable sobre el estudio con su m&eacute;dico, amigos, proveedores de servicios de salud y con personas que han participado en estudios cl&iacute;nicos. Ud. siempre debe averiguar si los estudios se est&aacuten haciendo en otros lugares, o si en su caso, otros medicamentos podr&iacute;an ayudarle mejor.</p>

<p>&#191; Qu&eacute; m&aacutes deber&iacute;a saber?</p>

<p>Usted deber&iacute;a pesar cuidadosamente su decisi&oacute;n de participar o no en un estudio cl&iacute;nico a la luz de los riesgos que Ud. quiera tomar. Si el estudio es controlado con placebo, uno de los riesgos es que Ud. tal vez no va a tomar ning&uacute;n medicamento. Por otro lado, el medicamento experimental que usted pudiera recibir, podr&iacute;a ser potencialmente da&ntildeino para usted.</p>

<p>Si la raz&oacute;n por la que a Ud. no le dejan participar en un estudio cl&iacute;nico es su raza, religi&oacute;n, etnicidad, nacionalidad, sexo, edad, orientaci&oacute;n sexual, hemofilia o historial de abuso de drogas, Ud. puede llevar un caso de discriminaci&oacute;n a trav&eacute;s de la Agencia de Derechos Humanos (Human Rights Agency).</p>

<p>Si del estudio cl&iacute;nico le piden que deje su m&eacute;dico y que s&oacute;lo tenga los servicios m&eacute;dicos de la cl&iacute;nica, Ud. deber&iacute;a pensarlo cuidadosamente. Ésto no es un requisito. Ud. puede seguir yendo a su doctor. Ir a su propio doctor en un lugar y a un estudio cl&iacute;nico en otro puede causar mucha tensi&oacute;n. Piense que su energ&iacute;a es algo muy importante y decida c&oacute;mo usarla. Puede ser que usted tenga que tomar tiempo de su trabajo o tener dinero adicional para pagar su transportaci&oacute;n al lugar del estudio. Preg&uacute;ntele al coordinador del estudio si ellos proveen transportaci&oacute;n o dinero para cubrir otras necesidades que usted pueda tener.</p>

<p>Ud. ser&aacute observado cuidadosamente durante el estudio. El doctor del estudio deber&aacute hablar sobre su cuidado m&eacute;dico con su doctor. Aseg&uacute;rese de que usted y su doctor reciban copias de todos los ex&aacutemenes de sangre hechos durante el estudio, y que usted discute con &eacute;l/ella los efectos secundarios que haya estado sintiendo. Algunas veces, a los investigadores no les es permitido ver los resultados de las pruebas de sangre hasta que todos los participantes hayan alcanzado cierto nivel en el estudio. Si este es el caso, el protocolo del estudio establecer&aacute cuando estas pruebas pueden ser vistas.</p>

<p>Algunas veces, la Junta Revisora Institucional (IRB), que es responsable de supervisar el estudio y proteger a los participantes, puede decidir cambiar el estudio por la informaci&oacute;n que hayan recogido hasta el momento. Si se observan efectos secundarios inaceptables, el estudio puede ser detenido.</p>

<h3><a name="participando">Participando</a> en un Estudio Cl&iacute;nico</h3>

&#191; C&oacute;mo puedo encontrar un estudio para participar? &#191; Cu&aacutento tiempo dura el estudio? &#191; Sabr&eacute; cu&aacutel medicamento estoy tomando? &#191; Qu&eacute; puede ocurrir si me enfermo mientras estoy en el estudio? &#191; Me ayudar&aacuten a conseguir mi propio m&eacute;dico? &#191; C&oacute;mo hago para participar en un estudio? &#191; Qu&eacute; es el Consentimiento Informado?</p>

<p>&#191; C&oacute;mo puedo encontrar un estudio para participar?</p>

<p>El n&uacute;mero sin cargos de la Red es el 1 (800) 734-7104. Organizaciones sin fines de lucro como la RED mantienen informaci&oacute;n al d&iacute;a sobre estudios de medicamentos y programas de tratamiento. Usted puede llamar a la Red para obtener informaci&oacute;n sobre un estudio cl&iacute;nico, o para discutir la informaci&oacute;n sobre un estudio antes de participar en &eacute;l. Tal vez su m&eacute;dico tenga informaci&oacute;n sobre los estudios cl&iacute;nicos y pueda sugerirle uno. Algunas cl&iacute;nicas hacen estudios y le pueden dar informaci&oacute;n sobre ellos. Tambi&eacute;n, puede llamar a la L&iacute;nea de Informaci&oacute;n sobre Tratamientos, "Infoline", del Instituto de SIDA del Departamento de Salud del estado de Nueva York, al 1 (800) MEDS 4 HIV. Igual, puede llamar a la l&iacute;nea nacional del servicio de informaci&oacute;n sobre estudios cl&iacute;nicos del SIDA (ACTIS), al 1 (800)TRIALSA.</p>

<p>&#191; C&oacute;mo hago para participar en un estudio?</p>

<p>Cada estudio tiene reglas estrictas de participaci&oacute;n. Los requisitos de un estudio se conocen como el Criterio de Inclusi&oacute;n y Exclusi&oacute;n. El criterio de inclusi&oacute;n son los requisitos que el participante debe tener para formar parte de un estudio. Por ejemplo, un requisito puede ser un conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4 mayor de 200 y/o tener m&aacutes de 13 a&ntildeos de edad. El criterio de exclusi&oacute;n son las cosas por las que no le dejan participar en un estudio, tales como ciertas medicinas que no pueda tomar mientras est&eacute; en el estudio.</p>

<P>Cuando encuentre un estudio que le interese, lo primero que debe hacer es llamar al lugar del estudio. El coordinador le har&aacute algunas preguntas. Si Ud. cumple con los requisitos b&aacutesicos del estudio, le dar&aacuten una cita para una entrevista. Durante esta entrevista, le har&aacuten preguntas detalladas sobre su salud. Usualmente, tambi&eacute;n le hacen un examen m&eacute;dico y pruebas de sangre.</p>

<p>&#191; C&oacute;mo es la experiencia de participar en un estudio?</p>

<P>Cada estudio es diferente, es importante saber cuales son los requisitos del estudio antes de unirse a &eacute;l. Deber&aacuten explicarle, cuidadosamente, todo lo que tiene que hacer mientras participa en el estudio. Por ejemplo, le pueden pedir que escriba en su casa sobre sus actividades diarias, o puede ser que le digan que no coma ciertas comidas. Usted, tambi&eacute;n deber&iacute;a saber las razones por las que le podr&iacute;an pedir que deje el estudio.</p>

<p>&#191; Con qu&eacute; frecuencia tendr&eacute; que ir al lugar del estudio?</p>

<p>Es posible que Ud. tenga que ir al estudio, por lo menos, una vez al mes o hasta cinco veces a la semana. Al principio, le har&aacuten muchos ex&aacutemenes m&eacute;dicos para ver qu&eacute; est&aacute haciendo el medicamento. M&aacutes adelante en el estudio ser&aacuten menos los ex&aacutemenes. P&iacute;dale a los investigadores el programa de citas para que pueda recordar las fechas.</p>

<p>&#191; El estudio tendr&aacute alg&uacute;n costo?</p>

<p>Los medicamentos que se usan en los estudios cl&iacute;nicos son dados gratis, pero en algunos lugares van a querer que su compa&ntilde&iacute;a de seguros o el Medicaid paguen los ex&aacutemenes de laboratorio. Es posible que le cobren por ser examinado para participar en un estudio. Si no quiere que su compa&ntilde&iacute;a de seguros sepa de su participaci&oacute;n, hable sobre esta preocupaci&oacute;n con los coordinadores del estudio. Si usted no tiene seguro m&eacute;dico o Medicaid, puede ser que del lugar del estudio paguen los ex&aacutemenes de laboratorio o puede ser que a usted le pidan pagarlos. Averigüe los costos en diferentes lugares antes de ser entrevistado/a. Anote los nombres y n&uacute;meros de tel&eacute;fonos de todos las personas con quien habla.</p>

<p>Tal vez, habr&aacute otros costos, tales como: tiempo fuera de su trabajo, gastos de transportaci&oacute;n, ni&ntildeera y cuido de ni&ntildeos. Algunos lugares cubren estos gastos y otros no. Quiz&aacutes el mismo estudio est&aacute siendo realizado en otros lugares cercanos. Averigüe el lugar que le sea m&aacutes conveniente.</p>

<p>&#191; Necesito tener mi propio m&eacute;dico?</p>

<p>¡Si! Participar en un estudio de medicamentos no es lo mismo que tener su propio m&eacute;dico. Los estudios de medicamentos no est&aacuten hechos para dar tratamiento a los participantes. Es muy importante tener su propio m&eacute;dico o cl&iacute;nica para hacerse ex&aacutemenes y pruebas de laboratorio con regularidad, mientras participa en el estudio.</p>

<p>&#191; Qui&eacute;n est&aacute a cargo del estudio?</p>

<p>La persona a cargo del estudio cl&iacute;nico en cada lugar es el investigador principal. El investigador usualmente es un doctor, aunque podr&iacute;a ser una enfermera u otro investigador cl&iacute;nico. Hay un grupo de doctores y enfermeras que hacen los ex&aacutemenes m&eacute;dicos y de la sangre, etc.</p>

<p>&#191; Qu&eacute; ocurre si me enfermo mientras estoy en el estudio?</p>

<p>Si su salud empeora mientras participa en el estudio, las personas a cargo del estudio averiguar&aacuten si &eacute;sto se debe al medicamento bajo estudio o a otra causa. Mantenga a su m&eacute;dico informado sobre todo lo que Ud. experimente durante el estudio.</p>

<p>Algunos medicamentos tienen efectos secundarios, tales como dolores de cabeza o dolores de est&oacute;mago. Otros medicamentos pueden causar enfermedades serias y hasta la muerte. Si el medicamento bajo estudio hace que se enferme, d&iacute;gaselo a los encargados del estudio. Ellos pueden decirle que deje de tomar el medicamento o le dar&aacuten una cantidad diferente. Si en el estudio est&aacuten comparando dos medicamentos, puede ser que le ofrezcan el otro medicamento.</p>

<p>Si Ud. se enferma y no es debido al medicamento, tal vez tendr&aacute que dejar el estudio. Es importante tener el n&uacute;mero de tel&eacute;fono de un m&eacute;dico o enfermero/a del estudio a quien pueda llamar las 24 horas del d&iacute;a, en caso de que se enferme durante la noche. Los medicamentos en estudios cl&iacute;nicos son experimentales, por &eacute;sto, puede ser que un doctor en una sala de emergencia no sepa qu&eacute; hacer si se enferma con el medicamento. Pregunte que usted podr&iacute;a hacer si esto pasara.</p>

<h3><a name="consent">El Consentimiento</a> Informado y la Seguridad</h3>

<p>&#191; Qu&eacute; es el Consentimiento Informado? &#191; Qui&eacute;n me protege cuando estoy en el estudio? &#191; Qu&eacute; es el Consentimiento Informado?</p>

<p>En la primera entrevista, le pedir&aacuten su consentimiento informado para participar en el estudio. El Consentimiento Informado quiere decir que despu&eacute;s de Ud. estar informado de todos los riesgos y beneficios posibles, Ud. est&aacute de acuerdo en participar en el estudio. La Forma de Consentimiento Informado explica las reglas del estudio en palabras sencillas. Este consentimiento debe estar escrito en su idioma, si no, le deben conseguir un int&eacute;rprete que se lo explique.</p>

<p>Est&eacute; seguro que Ud. entiende y est&aacute de acuerdo con lo que van a hacer en el estudio antes de firmar el consentimiento informado. Ud. debe tener su propia copia. Aun si Ud. firma este consentimiento, puede decidir dejar de participar en el estudio en cualquier momento, por cualquier raz&oacute;n. Si un ni&ntildeo est&aacute participando en un estudio cl&iacute;nico, le pedir&aacuten a los padres o guardi&aacuten que firme el consentimiento informado. Ésto querr&aacute decir que entienden los riesgos que el ni&ntildeo/a pueda correr al participar en el estudio.</p>

<p>Si Ud. participa en un estudio de medicamentos quiere decir que est&aacute de acuerdo en seguir las reglas del mismo. Las reglas del estudio se conocen como el protocolo, lo que explica exactamente como ser&aacute realizado. Si no se siente c&oacute;modo con las reglas del estudio porque no puede asistir a todas las citas, o porque no puede o quiere ir a una cl&iacute;nica donde la sala de espera est&aacute llena de gente enferma, hable con los encargados del mismo.</p>

<p>&#191; Qui&eacute;n me protege cuando estoy en el estudio?</p>

<p>Cada instituci&oacute;n que hace investigaciones m&eacute;dicas con seres humanos debe tener una Junta Revisora Institucional (IRB). Este es un requisito establecido por el gobierno federal. Esta junta est&aacute formada por un grupo de personas de distintas profesiones y son responsables de proteger los derechos de los participantes en el estudio. La junta debe aprobar cualquier estudio realizado en esa instituci&oacute;n y lo revisa cada cierta cantidad de tiempo.</p>

<p>La IRB puede detener un estudio porque no est&aacute haciendo lo que acord&oacute; o porque est&aacute poniendo a personas en peligro. Usted puede dejarle saber sus quejas a la IRB si tiene alg&uacute;n problema mientras participa en el estudio. Los encargados del estudio le dejar&aacuten saber como contactar la IRB. Usted tambi&eacute;n puede dejarle saber sus quejas a las personas a cargo del estudio, al Representante de Pacientes en el lugar del estudio, o a alguna organizaci&oacute;n que defiende los derechos de personas con SIDA.</p>

<h3><a name="dejando">Dejando</a> el Estudio</h3>

<p>&#191; Qu&eacute; ocurre cuando termina el estudio cl&iacute;nico? &#191; Qu&eacute; tipo de cuidado m&eacute;dico voy a tener una vez termina el estudio? &#191; Podr&eacute; obtener el medicamento una vez termina el estudio?</p>

<p>&#191; Qu&eacute; ocurre cuando termina el estudio?</p>

<p>Cuando el estudio termina, le dar&aacuten una "entrevista de salida". En esta entrevista le dir&aacuten el nombre del medicamento que estaba tomando, si usted no lo sab&iacute;a. Tambi&eacute;n le deber&aacuten decir si el estudio termin&oacute; antes de tiempo porque el medicamento no funcion&oacute; o porque era muy peligroso. Tal vez Ud. pueda seguir tomando el medicamento despu&eacute;s que el estudio termine, aunque no es una garant&iacute;a. Algunas veces, las compa&ntilde&iacute;as fabrican cierta cantidad del medicamento para el estudio y posteriormente deciden no producir m&aacutes.</p>

<p>&#191; Qu&eacute; tipo de cuidado m&eacute;dico voy a tener una vez termina el estudio?</p>

<p>Aseg&uacute;rese de saber como recibir cuidado m&eacute;dico a cualquier hora, inclusive, despu&eacute;s de terminar el estudio cl&iacute;nico. La cl&iacute;nica puede estar de acuerdo en darle cuidado m&eacute;dico una vez termina el estudio, pero deber&iacute;a hablar &eacute;sto desde el principio con el coordinador. Es posible que no puedan seguirle dando cuidado m&eacute;dico.</p>

<p>&#191; Podr&eacute; obtener el medicamento despu&eacute;s que termina el estudio?</p> 

<p>Algunos estudios le prometen el medicamento a los participantes despu&eacute;s que termina el estudio, pero en el pasado, no siempre ha sido posible obtenerlos.</p>

<p>&#191; C&oacute;mo podr&iacute;a dejar de participar en el estudio?</p>

<p>Ud. puede dejar el estudio en cualquier momento. Esto no debe afectar la calidad del servicio que le den en esta cl&iacute;nica u hospital en el futuro. Si el medicamento hace que se enferme y le piden que deje el estudio, los encargados del estudio deben estar seguros que usted tiene quien vele por sus necesidades m&eacute;dicas; aunque es probable que no paguen por ellas.</p>

<h3><a name="otras">Otras</a> Formas de Obtener Tratamientos</h3>

<P>Medicamentos de Acceso Extendido Tratamientos IND o Uso Compasivo, V&iacute;a paralela, Medicamentos de Acceso Extendido</p>

<p>Algunos medicamentos est&aacuten disponibles antes de que la FDA los apruebe para ser recetados. Esto es lo que se conoce como Acceso Extendido. Los medicamentos 3TC, d4T y ddI han estado disponibles a trav&eacute;s de este tipo de programa. Los medicamentos de Acceso Extendido casi siempre est&aacuten disponibles gratuitamente, pero usted tendr&aacute que pagar por las pruebas de laboratorio y los ex&aacutemenes f&iacute;sicos que sean requisito. Es un requisito que su doctor complete ciertos formularios sobre su reacci&oacute;n al medicamento, incluyendo pruebas de laboratorio y posibles efectos secundarios.</p>

<p>Los medicamentos de Acceso Extendido est&aacuten s&oacute;lo disponibles para personas que, por alguna raz&oacute;n, no pueden participar en un estudio de medicamentos. Es importante recordar que los medicamentos que se consiguen bajo este tipo de programa todav&iacute;a no han probado ser seguros y/o efectivos. Se espera que estudios futuros demuestren que lo son. La raz&oacute;n por la que los hacen disponibles de esta manera es para que la gente que tiene pocas alternativas de tratamientos tengan una oportunidad de tratar algo nuevo que podr&iacute;a tener mejores efectos. Por ejemplo, personas que ya han tratado el AZT, el ddI y el ddC y ya no son efectivos, podr&iacute;an tener otra alternativa.</p>

<p>Es posible que un estudio cl&iacute;nico de un nuevo medicamento ofrezca una opci&oacute;n similar. Si usted est&aacute interesado/a en participar en un estudio cl&iacute;nico, ll&aacutemenos para hablar sobre el estudio cl&iacute;nico o el programa de Acceso Extendido al que usted sea elegible. La RED tiene un listado completo de medicamentos que est&aacuten disponibles en farmace&uacute;ticas y a trav&eacute;s de programas hechos para personas que no pueden participar en un estudio cl&iacute;nico.

<p>En el pasado, a trav&eacute;s de protocolos de Uso Compasivo, los medicamentos experimentales han estado disponibles a personas que no han tenido otras opciones de tratamiento. Para formar parte de estos protocolos usted debe estar muy enfermo y no tener otras opciones de tratamiento. Usualmente, el Uso Compasivo es conocido como el Protocolo de Tratamiento IND ("Investigational New Drug"), Medicamento Nuevo bajo Investigaci&oacute;n.</p>

<h3><a name="cuales">&#191; Cu&aacuteles</a> preguntas deber&iacute;a hacer?</h3>

<p>Sobre el Estudio y sobre el Medicamento, Alimentaci&oacute;n y otros medicamentos, Consentimiento Informado, Dejando el estudio, Dinero</p> 

<p>Las respuestas a las preguntas que aparecen en las pr&oacute;ximas p&aacuteginas, le ayudar&aacuten a tomar una decisi&oacute;n informada sobre participar o no en un estudio cl&iacute;nico. Usted tiene derecho a que todas sus preguntas sean contestadas. Algunas, deber&aacuten ser aclaradas en La Forma de Consentimento Informado que el coordinador revisar&aacute con usted. Revise las preguntas con su propio m&eacute;dico antes de reunirse con el coordinador del estudio. Si&eacute;ntase libre de hacer cualquier otra pregunta que le preocupe.</p>

<p>Usted nunca debe sentir que est&aacute haciendo demasiadas preguntas o que est&aacute tomando mucho tiempo en la entrevista. Participar en el estudio le puede beneficar, pero &eacute;sto todav&iacute;a no ha sido probado. Los estudios cl&iacute;nicos necesitan seres humanos como usted para probar que el tratamiento sea efectivo. Usted es un(a) voluntario(a) y merece que sus preocupaciones sean consideradas.</p>

<p>Es una buena idea escribir las contestaciones de las preguntas, ya que m&aacutes tarde puede revisarlas y pensar sobre ellas. Puede ser que usted quiera tener un amigo/a que le pueda acordar las preguntas o escribirle las contestaciones.</p>

<p>Algunas preguntas no tienen respuesta, como los efectos secundarios a largo plazo de un nuevo medicamento. Los estudios cl&iacute;nicos se realizan para encontrar las respuestas a preguntas como estas. El coordinador del estudio le dir&aacute lo que podr&iacute;a pasar, pero tamb&iacute;en le podr&iacute;a decir que todav&iacute;a no saben. Usted tendr&aacute que decidir si est&aacute dispuesto(a) a correr los riesgos de participar en el estudio cl&iacute;nico.</p>

<p>Mientras un tratamiento experimental est&aacute en cualquier fase del estudio, nadie puede estar seguro de cuan bien trabaja el medicamento, o si trabaja. Mientras m&aacutes informado(a) est&eacute; sobre tratamientos disponibles, mejor preparado estar&aacute para tomar una decisi&oacute;n. Hable con otras personas que est&eacute;n participando en estudios cl&iacute;nicos, o llame a alguna organizaci&oacute;n comunitaria que trabaje con personas que tienen VIH o SIDA.</p>

<h2>Hojas Sueltas de <A HREF="../index.html">La Red</A></h2>

<p>Para obtener mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre otros tratamientos y sobre estudios cl&iacute;nicos de 3TC que actualmente est&aacute;n abiertos a participantes, vea la p&aacute;gina de <A HREF="../../trials/hiv.html">estudios cl&iacute;nicos</a> <I>(en ingl&eacute;s)</I>.</p>

<p>3TC, nombre de marca Epivir (tambi&eacute;n conocido como lamivudina), es un nuevo tratamiento contra el VIH de la misma clase de medicamentos que el AZT, ddI, ddC y d4T. Estos medicamentos son llamados nucle&oacute;sidos an&oacute;logos. El cuerpo convierte estos medicamentos en químicos que evitan que el VIH infecte nuevas c&eacute;lulas, pero no protegen a las c&eacute;lulas que ya han sido infectadas con el virus. Seg&uacute;n las personas con SIDA van perdiendo c&eacute;lulas T4, una de las defensas principales del sistema inmunol&oacute;gico, se van haciendo m&oacute;s propensos a una serie de infecciones y enfermedades.</p>
  
<p>Los estudios han demostrado que el 3TC puede aumentar los niveles de las c&eacute;lulas T4 y disminuir los niveles del VIH. M&oacute;s importante a&uacute;n, los estudios demuestran que el tratamiento con 3TC puede hacer que el AZT sea m&oacute;s efectivo, inclusive en personas que han estado tomando AZT por un largo período de tiempo. El 3TC ha sido aprobado por el gobierno para ser tomado en combinaci&oacute;n con AZT en personas con un conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4 menor de 500.</p>

<h3>Resultados de estudio</h3>

<p>En un estudio fue comparada la combinaci&oacute;n de AZT y 3TC con AZT solo.  Los participantes tenían un conteo inicial de T4 de 100-400 y menos de 4 semanas de tratamiento previo con AZT. Despu&eacute;s de 24 semanas de tratamiento los participantes tomaron 3TC y AZT en combinaci&oacute;n, durante otras 24 semanas. Hubo un aumento en los conteos de c&eacute;lulas T4 en quienes tomaron ambos medicamentos. En los conteos de estos participantes hubo un aumento promedio de 85 c&eacute;lulas en la semana 8, y de 80 c&eacute;lulas en la semana 24. En quienes tomaron AZT solo, fue visto un peque&ntilde;o aumento de c&eacute;lulas. Durante la segunda fase del estudio, las personas que comenzaron el tratamiento con AZT solo y a&ntilde;adieron el 3TC, tuvieron un aumento de 40 c&eacute;lulas T4. Los participantes que tomaron ambos medicamentos desde el principio tuvieron un aumento promedio de 49 c&eacute;lulas T4  en la semana 48. Los niveles del VIH en la sangre redujeron por m&oacute;s de un 90% con la terapia combinada y la cantidad de virus sigui&oacute; disminuyendo a trav&eacute;s de todo el a&ntilde;o. Solamente 5 personas abandonaron el estudio debido a los efectos secundarios.</p>

<p>En otro estudio, est&oacute; siendo comparado AZT y 3TC con AZT y ddC en personas que han tomado AZT por un tiempo promedio de dos a&ntilde;os y con un conteo promedio de c&eacute;lulas T4 de 211. Los participantes que estaban tomando AZT y 3TC fueron divididos en otros dos grupos. Un grupo tom&oacute; dosis bajas de 3TC con AZT y el otro grupo tom&oacute; dosis altas de 3TC con AZT. Los participantes en este estudio tenían la enfermedad m&oacute;s avanzada que aquellos que participaron en el primer estudio. Los niveles de virus en la sangre fueron casi los mismos en ambos grupos, despu&eacute;s de 6 meses de tratamiento. Los conteos de c&eacute;lulas T4 aumentaron un promedio de 32 c&eacute;lulas con la dosis baja de combinaci&oacute;n con 3TC; 15, con la dosis alta de combinaci&oacute;n con 3TC, y disminuyeron 15 c&eacute;lulas en la terapia combinada de AZT y ddC. Los estudios tambi&eacute;n han demostrado que el 3TC reduce la cantidad de virus de la hepatitis B, de tal forma que no se encuentra m&oacute;s virus en los participantes. Estos resultados se mantuvieron en 6 de 22 pacientes, despu&eacute;s de m&oacute;s de seis meses con la misma dosis.</p>

<h3>Efectos secundarios</h3>

<p>En estudios cl&iacute;nicos, los efectos secundarios como dolores de cabeza, n&oacute;usea y fatiga, fueron vistos en m&oacute;s de un cuarto de los participantes que estaban tomando la combinaci&oacute;n de 3TC y AZT. Otros efectos secundarios observados fueron: congesti&oacute;n nasal, diarrea, neuropat&iacute;a (dolor parecido al de una quemadura en el &oacute;rea de las manos y los pies), niveles bajos de gl&oacute;bulos blancos y anemia (niveles bajos de c&eacute;lulas rojas). Estos efectos secundarios son vistos m&oacute;s a menudo cuando el AZT es tomado solo. Algunos doctores sugieren que las personas que no pueden tomar AZT debido a los efectos secundarios que causa, consideren combinar 3TC con alg&uacute;n otro medicamento contra el VIH, como el d4T. Se est&oacute;n desarrollando estudios para ver si estas combinaciones pueden ser efectivas. El 3TC puede causar en los ni&ntilde;os, un efecto secundario llamado pancreatitis. La pancreatitis es una inflamaci&oacute;n peligrosa de un &oacute;rgano del cuerpo llamado pancreas. Los ni&ntilde;os que est&eacute;n tomando 3TC deben ser cuidadosamente monitoreados para manejar este efecto secundario.</p>

<h3>Estudios en la actualidad</h3>

<p>Actualmente hay estudios abiertos para investigar el 3TC en combinaci&oacute;n con otros medicamentos contra el VIH, en ni&ntilde;os y adultos. Para obtener mayor informaci&oacute;n llame a La Red, al (800) 734-7104. Tambi&eacute;n puede escribirnos al 611 Broadway, Suite 613, New York, NY  10012.</p>

<p>El 3TC tiene pocos efectos secundarios, mayormente: n&oacute;usea, v&oacute;mitos y dolores de cabeza y, en casos raros, p&eacute;rdida del cabello. El problema principal con este medicamento ha sido que no es efectivo usado solo. El 3TC puede dejar de funcionar pocas semanas despu&eacute;s de haber comenzado el tratamiento si el virus se vuelve resistente al medicamento. Sin embargo, pruebas de laboratorio han demostrado que cuando el virus se vuelve resistente al 3TC, deja de ser resistente al AZT. Esto indica que el 3TC funciona mejor cuando se toma con AZT.</p>

<p>La farmac&eacute;utica Glaxo-Wellcome tiene un programa de asistencia al paciente para personas que tienen problemas en obtener el medicamento. El n&uacute;mero al que puede llamar es el (800) 722-9294. Las personas que hayan estado recibiendo el medicamento a trav&eacute;s  del programa de acceso extendido y que ahora necesiten ayuda para gestionar reembolso de pagos, deben llamar al (800) 513-3028.</p>

<hr>

<P>La criptosporidiosis es una infecci&oacute;n causada por los criptosporidium, una infecci&oacute;n protorganismos unicelares), que usualmente afecta el tracto gastrointestinal (&eacute;stomago, intestinos, etc.). Los s&iacute;ntomas m&aacute;s comunes son: diarrea junto a dolor y calambres en el est&oacute;mago. La diarrea puede ser abundate (mucha) y acuosa (l&iacute;quida). Esta infecci&oacute;n tamb&eacute;n puede causar p&eacute;rdida de apetito y v&oacute;mitos. En personas que su sistema inmunol&oacute;gico no est&aacute; comprometido, la infecci&oacute;npuede lpresentarse sin que se experimenten s&iacute;ntomas o los s&iacute;ntomas desaparecen por si solos, aproximadamente en 30 d&iacute;as. Aunque, en ni&ntilde;os y adultos inmunocomprometidos, esta infecci&oacute;n puede causar una enfermedad severa y durar por mucho tiempo. El diagn&oacute;stico es realizado a trav&eacute;s de la identificaci&oacute;n del par&aacute;sito en pruebas de la defecac&iacute;on o por medio de biopsia de los intestinos. La criptosporidiosis ha sido incluida recientemente en la lista de infecciones que los m&eacute;dicos y otros proveedores de servicios de salud deben reportar al Departamente do Salud.</P>

<P>La v&iacute;a m&aacute;s com&uacute;n de infecci&oacute;n con criptosporidiosis es la oral-fecal. Los m&aacute;s susceptibles son ni&ntilde;os muy peque&ntilde;os, especialmente los que est&aacute;n en guarder&iacute;as (day care), los que practiqauen sexo oral-anal, y los que est&eacute;n en contacto cercano con personas ya infectadas. Algunas epidemias de criptosporidiosis se han propagado a trav&eacute;s de los sistemas de distribuci&oacute;n de agua. La criptosporidiosis fue encontrada por primera vez en un ser humano, en 1976. Antes de esto, se cre&iacute;a que la cripto solamente infectaba a los animales por lo que fue considerada un problema veterninario. Cerca de 1983, los casos en humanos comenzaron a aumentar. El aumento en la linfecci&oacute;n del VIH ha resultado en un aumento en la infecci&oacute;n de la criptosporidiosis . En las personas VIH+, la cripto puede causar una peligrosa deshidrataci&oacute;n y desnutrici&oacute;n. La diarrea causa deshidrataci&oacute;n y el cuerpo no puede funcionar sin mantener niveles adecuados de agua. Los s&iacute;ntomas de la criptosporidiosis incluyen: calambre abdominal, especialmente en el lado derecho, n&aacute;usea y diarrea hast por 21 d&iacute;as.</P>

<H3>Tratamientos</H3>

<P>Paromomicina (Humatin) y azitromicina son tratamientos usados contra la criptosporidiosis. Humatin est&aacute; siendo investigado actualmente en un estudio cl&iacute;nico. En &eacute;ste, los participantes so ndividios en dos grupos. Uno toma Humatin, el otro toma el placebo (p&iacute;ldora az&uacute;car). Ni los m&eacute;dicos ni los participantes saben el medicamente que est&aacute;n tomando (estudio doble-ciego). El tratamiento dura por tres semanas. Para m&aacute;s informaci&oacute;n sobre este estudio, llame a la RED. Humatin tambi&eacute;n est&aacute; disponible por receta. Azitromicina est&aacute; disponible por medio de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a que lo fabrica, a trav&eacute;s del programa de Tratamiento IND (Nuevo Medicamentos Bajo Investigaci&oacute;n). Este programa es para personas que no les han resultado los medicamentos convencionales o que no pueden tomarlos. Azitromicina viene en forma de p&iacute;ldora. Algunos tratamientos contra los s&iacute;ntomas de cripto son Immodium, octreotides y opi&aacute;ceos (substancias que vienen de opio y se usan para controlar dolor, etc.), contra la diarrea. El colostrum bovino hiperinmune (substancia que combate los microbios en el cuerpo), est&aacute; siendo estudiado para probar si puede aumentar la producci&oacute;n de inmunoglobulinos naturales en el cuerpo que combatan la cripto. La Nutrici&oacute;n Parenteral Total o la alimentaci&oacute;n intravenosa, algunas veces ha sido recomendada para reponer los nutrientes del cuerpo. Los infectados con cripto no deben comer comidas muy grasosas ya que son dif&iacute;ciles de digerir y aumentan la diarrea. Las comidas con lactosa (productos l&aacute;cteos como quesos, leche, healdo, etc.), producen efectos similares a los antes mencionados. </P>

<P>Para prevenir la cripto, as&iacute; como la hepatitis u otras infecciones, es muy importante lavarse las manos, especialmente despu&eacute;s de usar el ba&ntilde;o u antes de preparar comidas. Practicar el sexo m&aacute;s seguro reduce el riesgo de ser infectado con cripto. A las personas que tienen un conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4 menor de 200, se les recomienda hervir el agua que se van a tomar de 5 a 10 minutos. Se cree que esto puede bloquear la criptosporidia que causa la diarrea.</P>

<p>Para obtener mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre otros tratamientos y sobre estudios cl&iacute;nicos de d4T que actualmente est&aacuten abiertos a participantes, vea la p&aacutegina de <A HREF="../../trials/hiv.html">estudios cl&iacute;nicos</a> <i>(en ingl&eacute;s)</i>.</p>

<HR>

<P>El d4T es similar a otros medicamentos contra el VIH como el AZT, ddI y ddC. El cuerpo metaboliza estos medicamentos como qu&iacute;micos que evitan que el VIH infecte otras c&eacute;lulas no infectadas, pero esto no ayuda a otras c&eacute;lulas que ya han sido infectadas con el virus. Seg&uacute;n las personas con SIDA pierden c&eacute;lulas T4, una de las defensas principales del sistema inmune, se hacen m&aacute;s vulnerables a una serie de infecciones y enfermedades. Las personas que tomaron d4T en estudios cl&iacute;nicos tuvieron un moderado aumento en las c&eacute;lulas T4, algunas aumentaron de peso y se sintieron mejor. </P>
<P>Los otros nombres que se le dan a d4T son stavudine y Zerit. El d4T ha sido aprobado por la Administraci&oacute;n de Medicamentos y alimentos (FDA) para las personas que no pueden tomar AZT, ddI o ddC. Aunque el medicamento ha sido aprobado, una junta asesora de la FDA ha establecido que todav&iacute;a es desconocido el c&oacute;mo, cu&aacute;ndo y por qu&eacute; este medicamento deber&iacute;a ser usado.</P>
<P>El d4T puede ayudar a personas que han desarrollado resistencia al AZT y a otros medicamentos antivirales. Crear resistencia a un medicamento antiviral como el AZT puede significar que el virus podr&aacute; causar que la enfermedad sea agresiva. Se necesitan hacer m&aacute;s estudios sobre el medicamento antes de que se sepa la contestaci&oacute;n a esta pregunta. Se siguen realizando estudios cl&iacute;nicos sobre el d4T para tratar la infecci&oacute;n del VIH en ni&ntilde;os, y en combinaci&oacute;n con AZT y ddI para tratar la infecci&oacute;n en adultos. En otro estudio que se est&aacute; llevando a cabo se est&aacute; investigando el d4T para tratar el desgaste asociado a la infecci&oacute;n del VIH. Todav&iacute;a se desconoce como el d4T interact&uacute;a con otros medicamentos que una persona con SIDA pueda estar tomando. </P>
<P>En estudios anteriores de d4T, los conteos de c&eacute;lulas T4 de los participantes aumentaron o se mantuvieron iguales. Por otro lado, en los participantes que tomaron AZT el conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4 disminuy&oacute;. En la mayor&iacute;a de los participantes que eran positivos al ant&iacute;geno p24, la actividad de este indicador del VIH sigui&oacute; disminuyendo hasta seis meses despu&eacute;s de haber comenzado a tomar el medicamento. M&aacute;s de 10,000 personas con VIH y SIDA han tomado el d4T a trav&eacute;s de un programa especial patrocinado por Bristol Meyers/Squibb. Los cient&iacute;ficos est&aacute;n preocupados porque muy pocas mujeres, ni&ntilde;os y minor&iacute;as han tomado el d4T.</P>
<P>Los estudios demuestran que el d4T puede causar serios efectos secundarios en dosis altas, aunque la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a que hace el d4T dice que el medicamento tiene menos efectos secundarios que otros medicamentos antivirales. El efecto secundario m&aacute;s com&uacute;nmente visto es la neuropat&iacute;a periferal. Aunque el n&uacute;mero exacto de personas que podr&aacute;n tener esta condici&oacute;n es desconocido, algunos cient&iacute;ficos estiman que sobre 20% la tendr&aacute;n.</P>
<P>La forma en que usualmente se presenta la neuropat&iacute;a perif&eacute;rica es con sensaciones de dolor como de agujas calientes incando en las manos y/o las piernas. Las se&ntilde;ales iniciales son una sensaci&oacute;n de de ardor (quemaz&oacute;n) o adormecimiento, como un dolor agudo que aparece y desaparece , pero que siempre afecta el mismo &aacute;rea. Los s&iacute;ntomas iniciales de la neuropat&iacute;a perif&eacute;rica son sensaci&oacute;n de hormigueo en las puntas de los dedos, pies o piernas.</P>
<P>Otros posibles efectos secundarios del d4T son pruebas de la funci&oacute;n del h&iacute;gado elevadas y supresi&oacute;n de la m&eacute;dula &oacute;sea. La funci&oacute;n del h&iacute;gado debe ser cuidadosamente monitoreada si est&aacute; tomando d4T. La supresi&oacute;n de la m&eacute;dula &oacute;sea es monitoreada por medio de los resultados de las pruebas de laboratorio. Esta condici&oacute;n parece no ser tan frecuente con el d4T como con el AZT.</P>
<P>Los efectos secundarios m&aacute;s comunes y menos severos vistos con el uso de AZT ddI y ddC , tales como dolores de cabeza ocasionales o na&uacute;sea, tambi&eacute;n son vistos con el d4T. Al iniciar el uso de cualquier tratamiento antiretroviral siempre ocurren efectos secundarios temporeros tales como dolores de cabeza, hipertensi&oacute;n o una sensaci&oacute;n general de estar enfermo. Estos efectos secundarios suelen mejorar o hasta desaparecer con el tiempo.</P>

<hr>

<P>Los esteroides son una clase importante de compuestos biol&oacute;gicos en el cuerpo. Las hormonas sexuales son esteroides e incluyen la testosterona, el primer esteroide anab&oacute;lico en humanos. Los esteroides anab&oacute;licos son esteroides de masa en aumento en el tejido, lo que significa que ayudan en el crecimiento de m&uacute;sculos. El prop&oacute;sito de los esteroides anab&oacute;licos es aumentar la habilidad del cuerpo para usar la prote&iacute;na y hacer m&uacute;sculos. La forma en que el cuerpo usa la prote&iacute;na puede verse afectada por la infecci&oacute;n del VIH. Los esteroides anab&oacute;licos ayudan a enviar los amino&aacute;cidos de regreso a los m&uacute;sculos. Los amino&aacute;cidos son los bloques de prote&iacute;na necesarias para que el m&uacute;sculo crezca.</P>
<P>La testosterona se produce en los test&iacute;culos y en las gl&aacute;ndulas adrenales. Su funci&oacute;n es hacer los m&uacute;sculos y masculinizar. La testosterona que se produce naturalmente en el cuerpo es procesada r&aacute;pidamente por el h&iacute;gado y no circula en el cuerpo el tiempo suficiente como para ser usada como tratamiento. Formas orales sint&eacute;ticas de testosterona son procesadas m&aacute;s lentamente por el h&iacute;gado, pero tienden a crear toxicidad en &eacute;ste. Versiones sint&eacute;ticas de esta hormona han sido usadas para estimular a la m&eacute;dula &oacute;sea en la producci&oacute;n de c&eacute;lulas blancas y rojas en ciertas enfermedades autoinmunes en hombres y mujeres. F&oacute;rmulas de testosterona inyectable tienen media vida m&aacute;s de duraci&oacute;n que la testosterona que se produce naturalmente y es menos t&oacute;xica al h&iacute;gado que las f&oacute;rmulas orales. El uso continuo de dosis muy altas de cualquier esteroide anab&oacute;lico puede causar un grave s&iacute;ndrome llamado hepatitis peliosis. &Eacute;ste puede resultar en un serio da&ntilde;o al h&iacute;gado y en hemorragia estomacal. El uso de testosterona no es recomendado a las mujeres ya que todav&iacute;a no se han hecho estudios adecuados de testosterona en las mismas. </P>
<P>Los esteroides anab&oacute;licos, como la testosterona, ayudan en el crecimiento de los m&uacute;sculos y a deshacer la grasa. Tambi&eacute;n, pueden ser &uacute;tiles como parte de una dieta efectiva y un r&eacute;gimen de ejercicios para ganar y mantener peso. Las dosis usadas para mantener peso no son tan altas como para causar los efectos secundarios asociados con su uso entre atletas. Para mantener peso mientras se usan esteroides anab&oacute;licos, es necesario comer alimentos ricos en amino&aacute;cidos y en prote&iacute;nas. Una cantidad recomendable de prote&iacute;na es un gramo por cada libra del peso ideal. Consulte con un nutricionista sobre como obtener la cantidad adecuada de prote&iacute;na de las comidas y de los suplementos nutricionales. Cuatro comidas al d&iacute;a pueden ser mejor para usted que tres. Si no puede comer debido a los efectos secundarios de medicamentos e infecciones, la consulta con un nutricionista le puede ayudar a encontrar distintas formas de obtener suficientes fuentes de prote&iacute;na de suplementos nutricionales. La RED le puede referir a un nutricionista con experiencia trabajando con personas VIH+ o con SIDA. Si usted est&aacute; tomando esteroides anab&oacute;licos para aumentar y mantener su peso, su doctor debe considerar retirar el uso del medicamento de cada 6-8 semanas, para evitar los efectos secundarios. Si usted tiene alg&uacute;n historial de diabetes u otros problemas del h&iacute;gado, no deber&iacute;a usar esteroides anab&oacute;licos.</P>
<P>Para obtener informaci&oacute;n sobre el uso de esteroides anab&oacute;licos para tratar la p&eacute;rdida de peso asociada al VIH, llame a Anab&oacute;licos del SIDA al (213) 851-6734. Esta organizaci&oacute;n sin fines de lucro, solamente provee informaci&oacute;n, pero tambi&eacute;n puede proveer ejemplos de protocolos de tratamientos.

<p><font size=-1>Para obtener mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre otros tratamientos y sobre estudios cl&iacute;nicos contra retinitis de CMV que actualmente est&aacute;n abiertos a participantes, vea la p&aacute;gina de <A HREF="../../trials/cmvret.html">estudios cl&iacute;nicos</a> <i>(en ingl&eacute;s)</i>.</font></p>

<p>La enfermedad del CMV es una infecci&oacute;n causada por un virus llamado citomegalovirus.  Cuando el CMV infecta los ojos, es llamado CMV retinitis.  El CMV tambi&eacute;n puede afectar otras partes del cuerpo.  Ganciclovir y foscarnet son los dos medicamentos aprobados para tratar la enfermedad del CMV.  Ganciclovir tambi&eacute;n es llamado Cytovene y foscarnet es llamado Foscavir.  Ambos medicamentos osn dados en infusi&oacute;n intravenosa.  Las infusiones son dadas a trav&eacute;s de un cat&eacute;ter permanente que es colocado en el pecho para tener acceso a una vena grande.</p>

<p>Una vez Ud. tiene la enfermedad del CMV tiene que seguir el tratamiento diariamente, lo que es llamado tratamiento de mantenimiento.  Las infusiones intravenosas (IV) son dadas dos veces al d&iacute;a.</p>

<p>En estudios cl&iacute;nicos donde se ha comparado la c&aacute;psula y la v&iacute;a IV de ganciclovir como formas de terapia de mantenimiento, fue demostrado que la progresi&oacute;n de la retinitis del CMV en quienes estaban tomando la forma oral fue m&aacute;s r&aacute;pida que en los que estaban recibiendo infusiones IV.  Los mayores efectos secundarios de las c&aacute;psulas y de ganciclovir IV, son des&oacute;rdenes de la sangre llamados granulocitopenia, anemia y trombocitopenia.  Los efectos secundarios m&aacute;s comunes experimentados en quienes estaban tomando las c&aacute;psulas comparados con la infusi&oacute;n IV, fueron; diarrea fiebre, leucopenia y na&uacute;sea.</p>

<p>Resultados de estudios recientes demostraron que la profilaxis con ganciclovir oral puede retrasar el curso de la enfermedad del CMV en personas con un conteo bajo de c&eacute;lulas T4.  Profilaxis quiere decir que un medicamento es tomado para prevenir que la enfermedad est&eacute; activa.  Tomar las c&aacute;psulas para prevenci&oacute;n puede reducir a la mitad la enfermedad activa del CMV.  Aquellos que est&eacute;n tomando c&aacute;psulas de ganciclovir tienen que tomar G-CSF y eritropoietina debido a los efectos secundarios, ya que estimularon el crecimiento de c&eacute;lulas blancas m&aacute;s a menudo que en los participantes en el estudio que tomaron el placebo.</p>

<P>La compa&ntilde;&iacute;a del medicamento ha hecho que el ganciclovir oral para prevenci&oacute;n est&eacute; disponible a trav&eacute;s de un programa de acceso extendido.  Su doctor tiene que llamar a la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a para registrarse y luego llenar ciertos formularios para que la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a pueda recopilar datos sobre cuan bien el ganciclovir funciona como un tratamiento preventivo.</p>

<p>Actualmente se est&aacute;n realizando estudios para prevenir y tratar el CMV.  Hay un estudio de foscarnet abierto a participantes para tratar la colitis del CMV.  La colitis del CMV es la infecci&oacute;n del CMV en el alto o bajo tracto gastrointestinal.</p>

<p>Tambi&eacute;n hay un estudio abierto a participantes que compara diferentes tratamientos de la retinitis del CMV.  Los participantes ser&aacute;n tratados con ganciclovir IV, un implante en el ojo con ganciclovir oral o con un implante en el ojo solo.  Para participar Ud. debe tener retinitis del CMV en un ojo solamente.  El implante tambi&eacute;n est&aacute; disponible a trav&eacute;s de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a que fabrica el medicamento a trav&eacute;s del programa de uso compasivo, si usted no puede recibirlo por medio de otros tratamientos.  Llame a la RED para mayor informaci&oacute;n.</p>

<p>El comit&eacute; de la FDA encargado de revisar los resultados de estudios cl&iacute;nicos y de hacer recomendaciones, tuvo sus reservas en recomendar el ganciclovir oral para la prevenci&oacute;n del CMV porque existe la tendencia a crear resistencia al medicamento y porque tiene un costo promedio de $24,000 al a&ntilde;o.</p>

<P>Decidir tomar ganciclovir oral para prevenir el CMV es dif&iacute;cil.  Usted debe discutir los riesgos de contraer CMV con su doctor.  Existe la posibilidad de que si usted desarrolla CMV mientras toma ganciclovir oral, el CMV sea m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil de tratar porque puede crear resistencia.  La compa&ntilde;&iacute;a que produce el medicamento inform&oacute; que despu&eacute;s de 10 meses de tratamiento solamente un porciento de los participantes crearon resistencia a ganciclovir.  Se sabe, que una persona en el estudio de prevenci&oacute;n del CMV, desarroll&oacute; la enfermedad del CMV sin que pudiera ser tratada con ning&uacute;n medicamento contra el CMV, incluyendo el medicamento experimental HPMPC (cidofovir).</p>

<p><b>El Afta</b> (“thrush”) es la infecci&oacute;n de hongos m&aacute;s com&uacute;n y menos seria en personas VIH+. Puede afectar la boca, la garganta, la piel, el est&oacute;mago y la vagina. En una persona con un sistema inmunol&oacute;gico d&eacute;bil, el afta puede causar problemas m&aacute;s serios. Esta condici&oacute;n es llamada, algunas veces, candidiasis albicans. Tambi&eacute;n han sido descubiertos otros tipos de hongos, por lo que puede ser necesario tratar diferentes medicamentos adem&aacute;s de los que est&aacute;n siendo usados actualmente. Algunos medicamentos, tales como antibi&oacute;ticos, esteroides, medicamentos contra el c&aacute;ncer, pueden causar afta.</p>

<p><b>El Afta ora</b>l (en la boca) parece parchos blancos o rojos. Puede causar dolor de garganta, dolor al tragar y n&aacute;usea. Tambi&eacute;n puede quitarle el deseo de comer, hacer que comer sea doloroso y hacer que la comida sepa diferente. Los tratamientos contra el afta oral incluyen enjuagues bucales y tabletas llamadas troches. Algunas personas tratan el bicarbonato de soda (baking soda) o el per&oacute;xido de hidr&oacute;geno mezclado con agua para enjuagar la boca. Si el afta est&aacute; avanzado, &eacute;sto no suele funcionar. Otros tratamientos contra el afta incluyen clotrimazole, fluconazole y ketoconazole, y los mismos tienen diferentes nombres de marcas. Estos medicamentos pierden el efecto cuando son tomados por un largo per&iacute;odo de tiempo, aunque est&aacute;n siendo estudiados nuevos medicamentos y nuevas formas de usarlos.</p>

<p><b>La Candidiasis Vagina</b>l es una infecci&oacute;n com&uacute;n de levadura en la vagina. Una infecci&oacute;n de levadura puede ser el primer signo de que una mujer es VIH+. Los s&iacute;ntomas incluyen picaz&oacute;n severa, quemaz&oacute;n y una descarga espesa, a menudo blanca. Es posible que una infecci&oacute;n no diagnosticada, como la TB, pueda causar una infecci&oacute;n vaginal de levadura. Las tabletas nystatin son usadas para el tratamiento. El ung&uuml;ento de clotrimazole es otro tratamiento, que tambi&eacute;b es dado sin receta como el Gyne-Lotrimin, Lotrimin o Mycelex. Los estudios han demostrado que puede ser que las mujeres VIH negativas tengan que tomar DiFlucan, solamente una vez, para tratar esta condici&oacute;n. Siempre consulte a su m&eacute;dico antes de comenzar cualquier tratamiento.</p>

<p><b>La meningitis criptococca</b> es una infecci&oacute;n de hongos muy seria. Es causada por un hongo encontrado, mayormente, en la tierra y en el excremento de los p&aacute;jaros. Meningitis significa inflamaci&oacute;n de las meninges. Las meninges cubren el cerebro y la espina dorsal.</p>

<p>Los s&iacute;ntomas causados por infecci&oacute;n criptococa pueden ser dif&iacute;ciles de reconocer. Est&eacute; pendiente a: fiebre, v&oacute;mitos, dolores de cabeza, n&aacute;usea, fatiga, p&eacute;rdida de apetito y un malestar general. Otros s&iacute;ntomas son tort&iacute;colis y ataques poco frecuentes. La pneumon&iacute;a puede ser un s&iacute;ntoma temprano de la infecci&oacute;n. D&iacute;gale a su doctor los s&iacute;ntomas que tiene tan pronto los siente.</p>

<p>Un tratamiento com&uacute;n contra esta condici&oacute;n es la anfotericina B, que puede ser dada en inyecc&ooacute;n intravenosa. Un nuevo tratamiento, que en algunos casos puede ser dado en p&iacute;ldoras o en inyecc&ooacute;n intravenosa, es el fluconazole o el Diflucan. Muchas personas prefieren este tratamiento porque causa menos efectos secundarios.</p>

<p><b>La Histoplasmosis</b> es una infecci&oacute;n de hongos que puede causar la muerte y com&uacute;nmente ocurre en el suroeste de los Estados Unidos. En el pasado, la histoplasmosis era solamente tratable con anfotericina intravenosa. El itraconazole es usado actualmente, aunque puede que no sea efectivo en tratar la histoplasmosis que ataca el sistema nervioso central y el cerebro. Esto se debe a que el itraconazole no logra penetrar bien en el fluido cerebroespinal, que es el fluido que rodea la espina dorsal y el cerebro.</p>

<p><b>La Blastomicosis</b> es una infecci&oacute;n de hongos que ataca los pulmones y ocasionalmente se riega por la piel. Este hongo proviene de una fuente natural desconocida. La mayor&iacute;a de los casos provienen de los estados del sureste y del valle del R&iacute;o Mississipi, y se desarrolla en hombres entre las edades de 20 a 40 a&ntilde;os. Cuando la infecci&oacute;n ocurre en los pulmones los s&iacute;ntomas iniciales son: tos seca o tos con flema, dolor en el pecho, fiebre, escalofr&iacute;os, sudores fuertes en todo el cuerpo y falta de respiraci&oacute;n. Si no es tratada la enfermedad, puede causar la muerte lentamente. La anfotericina B es altamente efectiva. Se comienza a ver una mejor&iacute;a una semana despu&eacute;s de tomar el medicamento, y los organismos desaparecen r&aacute;pidamente.</p>

<p>Para informaci&oacute;n sobre cualquier medicamento nuevo o experimental para tratar las infecciones de hongos, llame al “Access Project” (800) 734-7104. Los tratamientos contra el afta vienen en diferentes formas, tales como enjuagues bucales o tabletas. Se est&aacute;n realizando estudios para ver si personas VIH+ pueden tomar medicinas que prevengan el afta. Algunas personas usan diferentes emedios caseros. Dos formas, todav&iacute;a no aprobadas, que se cree que pueden detener el crecimiento del afta son usar grandes cantidades de ajo y evitar comidas que contengan az&uacute;car, levadura o productos l&aacute;cteos.</p>

<p><font size=-1>Para obtener mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre otros tratamientos y sobre estudios cl&iacute;nicos que actualmente est&aacute;n abiertos a participantes, vea la p&aacute;gina de <A HREF="../hiv.html">estudios cl&iacute;nicos</a> <i>(en ingl&eacute;s)</i>.</font></p>

<p>Las inmunoglobulinas (lg) son anticuerpos que el cuerpo produce como una respuesta a una infecci&oacute;n.  Cuando el sistema inmunol&oacute;gico est&aacute; deteriorado los niveles de inmunoglobulina pueden estar m&aacute;s bajos que cuando el cuerpo necesita combatir una infecci&oacute;n.  La inmunoglobulina concentrada intravenosa es usada para tratar a ni&ntilde;os que su sistema inmunol&oacute;gico no est&aacute; funcionando adecuadamente, y tambi&eacute;n est&aacute; siendo desarrollada para tratar otras enfermedades.</p>

<p>La terapia pasiva hiperinmune (PHT) usa el plasma de la sangre de donantes que son VIH+ que no tienen s&iacute;ntomas y que aparentemente est&aacute;n controlando bien el virus.  Este plasma es esterilizado para evitar transmitir cualquier nuevo virus y luego es dado en infusi&oacute;n a personas con SIDA.  El plasma contiene anticuerpos y, quiz&aacute;s, otras substancias que podr&iacute;an beneficiar a quienes han perdido la capacidad de producirlos.  Este tipo de acercamiento a los tratamientos ha sido usado exitosamente con otras enfermedades.</p>

<p>El tratamiento consiste en dar infusiones mensuales del plasma de la sangre de personas VIH+, que todav&iacute;a est&eacute;n saludables, a aquellos que han desarrollado s&iacute;ntomas cl&iacute;nicos de la enfermedad.  El tratamiento depender&aacute; de las personas VIH+ saludables que puedan hacer donaciones de plasma, con regularidad, para el beneficio de otros.  Cuando este tratamiento es dado una o dos veces a la semana a personas con SIDA, parece reducir significativamente los s&iacute;ntomas del SIDA y de las infecciones oportunistas.  Mientras que la PHT parece ser un tratamiento relativamente seguro contra el SIDA, todav&iacute;a no han sido demostrados beneficios cl&iacute;nicos a largo plazo.  De hecho, han ocurrido algunos serios efectos en personas que han descontinuado la terapia, incluyendo un aumento en la cantidad de infecciones oportunistas, desgaste y deterioraci&oacute;n neurol&oacute;gica.  Adem&aacute;s, esta terapia es costosa y requiere trabajo intensivo.  La PHT no previene la diseminaci&oacute;n del virus de c&eacute;lula a c&eacute;lula y puede no ser efectivo contra las m&uacute;ltiples cepas del virus que com&uacute;nmente se encuentran en las personas con SIDA.</p>

<p>En los resultados de un estudio se encontraron beneficios solamente en las personas que ten&iacute;an un conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4 entre 50 y 200.  No hubo diferencias significativas entre los distintos grupos de infecciones oportunistas.  Esto difiere de los resultados de un estudio franc&eacute;s, en el que se encontraron tres veces m&aacute;s de enfermedades asociadas al SIDA, en el grupo que estaba tomando el placebo.  En la 10ma  Conferencia Internacional del SIDA en Yokohama, de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a farmace&uacute;tica Verigen Inc., fueron presentados resultados que indicaban alg&uacute;n &eacute;xito en las pruebas del tratamiento con la f&oacute;rmula intravenosa de inmunoglobulina G (IgG), llamado PASSHIV-1  Los resultados mostraron que esta terapia no es una cura pero es bien tolerada cuando es administrada repetidamente y puede tener efectos cl&iacute;nicos, antivirales e inmunol&oacute;gicos importantes.  Todos los participantes en el estudio han mostrado tener una mejor&iacute;a, por lo menos en uno de los s&iacute;ntomas cl&iacute;nicos, cuando han estado tomando el medicamento durante dos o tres meses.  Adem&aacute;s, no se han visto signos cl&iacute;nicos adversos relacionados a cuando se ha vuelto a administrar el tratamiento.  Los conteos de c&eacute;lulas T4 permanecieron sin grandes cambios por un per&iacute;odo de sobre tres a seis meses, y  el ant&iacute;geno p24 no mostr&oacute; actividad por un per&iacute;odo de sobre dos a tres meses.  Los niveles del ant&iacute;geno p24 son una medida utilizada para determinar la cantidad del VIH que hay en la sangre.</p>

<p>La compa&ntilde;&iacute;a farmace&uacute;tica HemaCare someti&oacute; a la Administraci&oacute;n de Medicamentos y Alimentos (FDA) en julio de 1994, una nueva aplicaci&oacute;n de un Nuevo Medicamento para ser Investigado (NDA). El nombre de dicho tratamiento es “Immupath”.  En el nuevo estudio ser&aacute; monitoreada el plasma de donantes VIH+: participantes VIH+ con conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4 entre 50 y 200 y participantes VIH+ con conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4 entre 200 y 400.  “Immupath” es una globulina inmune intravenosa (IVIG) con concentraci&oacute;n de anticuerpos.  Al “Immupath” se le ha dado el estatus de f&aacute;rmaco hu&eacute;rfano (medicamento producido en cantidades limitadas para condiciones poco comunes).</p>

<p>Toda la informaci&oacute;n que hay disponible indica que la donaci&oacute;n de plasma no es da&ntilde;ina a personas con VIH.  Algunos datos sugieren que que las donaciones pueden ser beneficiosas.  No se han documentado toxicidades mayores o efectos secundarios, a excepci&oacute;n de leves fiebres, en los donantes o los participantes que las han recibido.  La PHT puede ser muy costosa, llegando a tener un precio de $300 por tratamiento.</p>

<h1>implantes de ganciclovir contra retinitis de CMV</H1>

<h2>Hojas Sueltas de <A HREF="../index.html">La Red</A></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><font size=-1>Para obtener mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre otros tratamientos y sobre estudios cl&iacute;nicos contra retinitis de CMV que actualmente est&aacute;n abiertos a participantes, vea la p&aacute;gina de <A HREF="../../trials/cmvret.html">estudios cl&iacute;nicos</a> <i>(en ingl&eacute;s)</i>.</font></p>

<p>La retinitis del CMV es una infecci&oacute;n en el ojo causada por el citomegalovirus.  El CMV tambi&eacute;n puede infectar otras partes del cuerpo.  Los investigadores han estado estudiando un implante especial que es colocado directamente en el ojo infectado.  El implante libera lentamente el ganciclovir, un medicamento usado para tratar la infecci&oacute;n del CMV.  Los implantes han mostrado buenos resultados cuando la infecci&oacute;n es solamente en el ojo.</p>

<p>Entre octubre de 1992 y diciembre de 1993, 26 participantes con retinitis del CMV recientemente diagnosticada, se matricularon en un estudio desarrollado en Bethesda, Maryland y Atlanta, Georgia.  Los participantes fueron divididos en dos grupos.  Al primer grupo se le dio el implante inmediatamente y al segundo grupo, se le daba el implante solamente si la retinitis empeoraba.  Las personas que participaron en el estudio no tuvieron una progresi&oacute;n en la retinitis diagnosticada recientemente, por aproximadamente, 8 meses despu&eacute;s de haber estado usando el implante de ganciclovir.  Entre los que no recibieron tratamiento inmediato, la infecci&oacute;n del ojo empeor&oacute; en, aproximadamente, 15 d&iacute;as.  Aunque se requiere una cirug&iacute;a para poder usar el implante, la misma es realizada con anestesia local en menos de una hora y puede ser hecha ambulatoria.  Los implantes est&aacute;n dise&ntilde;ados para liberar ganciclovir por cierta cantidad de meses.  El mejor momento para reemplazar el implante a&uacute;n es desconocido.  En el estudio realizado, los implantes liberaban el ganciclovir en diferentes cantidades, por lo que era dif&iacute;cil saber cuando era necesario reemplazar el implante.  La informaci&oacute;n que se tiene en la actualidad, es que &eacute;ste debe ser reemplazado despu&eacute;s de 32 semanas para aminorar las posibilidades de que haya alg&uacute;n deterioro.  La mayor&iacute;a de los participantes en el estudio disfrutaron de una buena visi&oacute;n con el implante.  Para la &uacute;ltima visita de seguimiento de examinaci&oacute;n del ojo, 34 de 39 ojos tratados con el implante tuvieron una visi&oacute;n casi perfecta (20/25).  Los investigadores tambi&eacute;n reportaron que casi todos los ojos afectados tuvieron la visi&oacute;n borrosa inmediatamente despu&eacute;s de recibir el implante de ganciclovir.  Los participantes volvieron a tener una visi&oacute;n normal dentro de un tiempo promedio de 4 semanas.</p>

<p>Existe la preocupaci&oacute;n de que aquellos que reciben el tratamiento puedan desarrollar infecciones del CMV en el ojo no afectado o en cualquier otra parte del cuerpo, debido a que el implante solamente libera ganciclovir en el ojo.  En &eacute;ste estudio, los investigadores reportaron un alto porcentaje de infecci&oacute;n en el segundo ojo.  De los 21 pacientes que ingresaron al estudio con un solo ojo afectado, 14 desarrollaron la retinitis del CMV en el otro ojo.  Los doctores trataron a 11 de estos pacientes con implantes de ganciclovir en el segundo ojo, obteniendo similares buenos resultados.  Adem&aacute;s, 8 de los 26 participantes en el estudio, desarrollaron infecciones del CMV en otros &oacute;rganos.  &Eacute;stos pacientes fueron tratados con ganciclovir intravenoso o foscarnet, el tratamiento aprobado contra el CMV.</p>

<p>Hay un estudio en el que se comparan diferentes tratamientos contra la retinitis del CMV que est&aacute; abierto a participantes.  Los participantes ser&aacute;n divididos en tres grupos.  El primer grupo ser&aacute; tratado con ganciclovir IV est&aacute;ndar.  El segundo grupo ser&aacute; tratado con un implante de ganciclovir y con ganciclovir oral.  El tercer grupo ser&aacute; tratado con un implante y con el placebo.  En los dos grupos que reciban el implante y el ganciclovir oral o el placebo, ni los participantes ni el doctor sabr&aacute;n quien recibir&aacute; el ganciclovir oral o el placebo.  Para participar, Ud. debe tener retinitis del CMV en un ojo.  Los participantes que desarrollen la enfermedad del CMV en otras partes del cuerpo deber&aacute;n dejar el estudio, pero recibir&aacute;n un implante y el ganciclovir oral.  Las visitas a la cl&iacute;nica ser&aacute;n cada 2 semanas.  El implante tambi&eacute;n est&aacute; disponible a trav&eacute;s de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a que produce el medicamento por medio de un programa de uso compasivo, si usted no puede recibir otros tratamientos.</p>

<p>Si usted est&aacute; teniendo visi&oacute;n borrosa u otros problemas con sus ojos, es importante que vea a un oftalm&oacute;logo que tenga experiencia en examinar y tratar a personas con VIH.  No lo posponga.  Las complicaciones con los ojos pueden volverse permanentes e inclusive llevar a la ceguera si no son tratadas a tiempo.  Un oftalm&oacute;logo es un doctor que se especializa en condiciones relacionadas con los ojos.</p>

<blockquote><font size=-1>
<p>Para obtener mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre otros tratamientos y sobre estudios cl&iacute;nicos que actualmente est&aacute;n abiertos a participantes, vea la p&aacute;gina de <A HREF="../hiv.html">estudios cl&iacute;nicos</a></p>

<hr size=3 width=50% align=center>

<p>Indinavir (nombre de marca Crixivan, tambi&eacute;n conocido como MK-639) pertenece al nuevo grupo de medicamentos contra el VIH, llamados <a href="protease.html">inhibidores de proteasa</a>. Estos medicamentos obstruyen una parte del virus del VIH llamada proteasa. Cuando la proteasa es bloqueada, el VIH hace copias de s&iacute; mismo que no pueden infectar nuevas c&eacute;lulas.</p>

<p><b>Resultados de estudios</b><br>
Actualmente se est&aacute; realizando un estudio donde se investiga la combinaci&oacute;n de indinavir, AZT y 3TC. Los participantes de este estudio han estado tomando AZT por lo menos seis meses antes de comenzar el estudio. Tambi&eacute;n, fueron asignados al azar a tomar indinavir/AZT/3TC, indinavir solo o AZT y 3TC. Despu&eacute;s de 16 semanas, 24 de las 26 personas que tomaron la triple combinaci&oacute;n de indinavir, AZT y 3TC ten&iacute;an tan poco virus en la sangre que no pudo ser detectado usando la prueba est&aacute;ndar de carga viral. En esta prueba no se pueden detectar menos de 500 copias del VIH en un mililitro de sangre. 13 de 26 personas que tomaron indinavir solo, tambi&eacute;n tuvieron menos de 500 copias del VIH en sus muestras de sangre. En ninguna de las personas que tomaron AZT y 3TC fue reducida la cantidad del VIH de su sangre a menos de 500 copias.</p>

<p>A algunos de los participantes en este estudio se les ha dado seguimiento por 24 semanas. 6 de 7 personas que tomaron indinavir/AZT/3TC todav&iacute;a ten&iacute;an el nivel del virus por debajo de lo que puede detectar la prueba de carga viral. 4 de 9 personas que tomaron indinavir solo, tambi&eacute;n ten&iacute;an el nivel del virus por debajo de lo que puede detectar la prueba de carga viral. Ninguna de las personas que tomaron AZT/3TC ten&iacute;an niveles indetectables del virus.</p>

<p>El aumento promedio de c&eacute;lulas T4 despu&eacute;s de 24 semanas fue de 146 en el grupo que tom&oacute; indinavir/AZT/3TC, 77 en quienes tomaron indinavir solo y 22 en quienes tomaron AZT/3TC. Otros estudios de indinavir parecen confirmar que &eacute;ste tiene un fuerte efecto contra el VIH. En un peque&ntilde;o estudio donde fueron combinados indinavir/AZT y ddI, se encontr&oacute; que los participantes tuvieron un aumento promedio de 90 c&eacute;lulas T despu&eacute;s de 24 semanas.</p>

<p>Es importante recordar que estos resultados han sido obtenidos en un peque&ntilde;o grupo de personas y todav&iacute;a no se sabe si ser&aacute;n confirmados en estudios m&aacute;s amplios. Todav&iacute;a no ha sido probado si el medicamento ayudar&aacute; a la gente a vivir por m&aacute;s tiempo o a estar saludables por m&aacute;s tiempo. Sin embargo, estudios recientes han demostrado que al reducir la cantidad de virus en la sangre tambi&eacute;n se reducen las posibilidades de muerte o de que progrese la enfermedad. Esto podr&iacute;a significar que medicamentos como indinavir ayuden a las personas a vivir por m&aacute;s tiempo y m&aacute;s saludables.</p>

<p><b>Resistencia</b><br>
El VIH puede crear resistencia a indinavir. Esto fue visto en estudios anteriores donde la dosis de indinavir era m&aacute;s baja que la recomendada actualmente. Despu&eacute;s de 24 semanas en el estudio, los niveles del VIH en la sangre de estos participantes volvieron al nivel en que estaban antes de comenzar el estudio. Sin embargo, el aumento promedio de 80 a 100 c&eacute;lulas T4, fue mantenido por 52 semanas. Esto podr&iacute;a significar que el VIH resistente a indinavir es menos peligroso para el sistema inmunol&oacute;gico que el VIH "normal". Estudios adicionales se est&aacute;n realizando para investigar &eacute;sto. Parece ser que la resistencia ocurre mucho m&aacute;s lentamente con la nueva dosis que est&aacute; siendo usada.</p>

<p><b>Tomando el medicamento</b><br>
La dosis recomendada de indinavir es de 800 mg cada 8 horas. El medicamento debe ser tomado con agua con el est&oacute;mago vac&iacute;o, ya sea una hora antes de comer o dos horas despu&eacute;s de comer. Adem&aacute;s, indinavir podr&iacute;a ser tomado con otros l&iacute;quidos, tales como: leche descremada, jugo, caf&eacute;, t&eacute; o con una comida ligera, como tostadas con jalea, jugo y caf&eacute; con leche descremada y az&uacute;car; o "corn flakes", leche descremada y az&uacute;car. Es recomendable tomar por lo menos 1.5 litros (aproximadamente 48 onzas) de l&iacute;quidos durante un per&iacute;odo de 24 horas para evitar la deshidrataci&oacute;n y las piedras en los ri&ntilde;ones.</p>

<p>Para evitar desarrollar resistencia al medicamento es muy importante no olvidar tomarlo. Si usted olvida tomarlo, no tome una doble dosis la pr&oacute;xima vez que le toque. Trate de mantenerse lo m&aacute;s cerca posible al horario de cada 8 horas, ya que as&iacute; se mantiene un nivel constante de indinavir en el cuerpo, haci&eacute;ndole m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil al VIH crear resistencia al medicamento.</p>

<p><b>Interacci&oacute;n con otros medicamentos</b><br>
El efecto del antibi&oacute;tico rifabutin (Mycobutin) puede ser alterado por indinavir. Se recomienda que sea usada la mitad de la dosis recetada de rifabutin cuando es tomado con indinavir. El medicamento ketoconazole (Nizoral) puede aumentar los niveles en la sangre de indinavir. Si usted est&aacute; tomando Ketoconazole deber&iacute;a considerar reducir la dosis de indinavir a 600 mg cada 8 horas.</p>

<p><b>Disponibilidad</b><br>
Indinavir solamente estar&aacute; disponible por correo, por lo menos hasta octubre de 1996, a trav&eacute;s de las Farmacias Stadlanders, debido a la producci&oacute;n limitada del medicamento. Para mayor informaci&oacute;n puede llamar al (800) 927-8888.</p>

<P><i><b>Efectos secundarios</b><br>
Los efectos secundarios m&aacute;s comunes causados por indinavir son: piedra en los ri&ntilde;ones y nivel alto temporero de una enzima del h&iacute;gado llamada bilirrubina. Esto ha sido visto en alrededor de 2-3% de las personas que han tomado el medicamento. Por lo regular la bilirrubina vuelve por s&iacute; sola a un nivel normal.</i></p>

<p>La farmac&eacute;utica Merck, fabricante de indinavir, ha desarrollado un <a href="../../access/pa/indi.html">programa de ayuda al paciente</a> para las personas que tienen dificultades pagando el medicamento. Para mayor informaci&oacute;n, llame al (800) 850-3430.Si su compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de seguro, HMO, ADAP o Medicaid todav&iacute;a est&aacute; decidiendo si va a cubrir indinavir y usted cumple con los requisitos del programa de ayuda al paciente, usted podr&iacute;a cualificar para recibir el medicamento por tres meses. Sin embargo, si su compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de seguro, HMO, ADAP o Medicaid deciden NO cubrir el medicamento usted no ser&aacute; elegible para recibir el medicamento gratis a trav&eacute;s del programa de ayuda al paciente. Es posible que usted solamente pueda obtener ayuda en encontrar otras fuentes de reembolso para el medicamento.</p>

<h2>Hojas Sueltas de <A HREF="../index.html">La Red</A></h2>

<p>Para obtener mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre otros tratamientos y sobre estudios cl&iacute;nicos contra HIV que actualmente est&aacute;n abiertos a participantes, vea la p&aacute;gina de <A HREF="../hiv.html">estudios cl&iacute;nicos</a>.</p>

<hr size=3 width=50% align=center>

<p>Los inhibidores de proteasa son un nuevo tipo de medicamentos contra el VIH. Estos medicamentos obstruyen una parte del virus del VIH llamada proteasa. Cuando la proteasa es bloqueada, el VIH hace copias de s&iacute; mismo que no pueden infectar nuevas c&eacute;lulas. Hasta el momento, los inhibidores de proteasa parecen ser menos t&oacute;xicos y tener menos efectos secundarios que los medicamentos aprobados contra el VIH (AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T y 3TC - estos medicamentos son llamados nucle&oacute;sidos an&aacute;logos).</p>

<p>Los estudios han demostrado que los inhibidores de proteasa pueden reducir la cantidad de virus en la sangre y aumentar el conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4. En algunos casos, estos medicamentos han aumentado los conteos de c&eacute;lulas T4 a&uacute;n cuando eran muy bajos. Dos estudios recientes han demostrado que los inhibidores de proteasa pueden ayudar a prolongar la vida y a que se desarrollen menos infecciones oportunistas.</p>

<p>Los estudios tambi&eacute;n han demostrado que estos efectos pueden desaparecer con el tiempo. Esto sucede porque el VIH hace r&eacute;plicas de s&iacute; mismo constantemente, y cada nuevo virus del VIH puede ser ligeramente diferente. El tipo de proteasa que el VIH crea puede ser ligeramente diferente a la que cre&oacute; anteriormente. La nueva proteasa que el virus ha creado puede que no tenga ninguna reacci&oacute;n al medicamento que funcion&oacute; con el otro tipo de proteasa. Esto se debe en gran medida a lo que los cient&iacute;ficos llaman resistencia.</p>

<p>En la actualidad, es muy importante evitar que el VIH cree resistencia a los inhibidores de proteasa. Si el VIH crea resistencia contra un inhibidor de proteasa tambi&eacute;n podr&iacute;a crearla contra otros y esto podr&iacute;a limitar sus opciones de tratamientos.</p>

<p>Para evitar o tratar de retrasar la resistencia es muy importante seguir las dosis y el horario del inhibidor que usted est&eacute; tomando. Aseg&uacute;rese de saber como debe ser tomado el medicamento: con el est&oacute;mago vac&iacute;o o lleno. Tambi&eacute;n est&eacute; al tanto de los efectos secundarios y cosas que usted podr&iacute;a hacer para contrarrestarlos. La Red tiene Hojas Sueltas sobre cada uno de los inhibidores de proteasa: <a href="saquin.html">saquinavir (Invirase)</a>, <a href="riton.html">ritonavir (Norvir)</a> e <a href="indi.html">indinavir (Crixivan)</a>.</p>

<p>En resultados de estudios recientes donde se ha investigado la combinaci&oacute;n de los inhibidores de proteasa con otros medicamentos contra el VIH, tales como AZT y 3TC, se ha encontrado una gran reducci&oacute;n en la cantidad del VIH en el cuerpo. Este tipo de terapia combinada podr&iacute;a hacer que los medicamentos funcionen por m&aacute;s tiempo y que la resistencia no sea un mayor problema. Debido a &eacute;sto, ha sido recomendado que los inhibidores de proteasa sean tomados en combinaci&oacute;n con , por lo menos, un nucle&oacute;sido an&aacute;logo. Si es posible, otros dos medicamentos nucle&oacute;sidos an&aacute;logos deben ser usados con el inhibidor de proteasa. Esto es lo que se llama "terapia combinada triple".</p>

<p>Tambi&eacute;n, se est&aacute;n llevando a cabo estudios de inhibidores de proteasa combinados. Hasta que no haya informaci&oacute;n disponible sobre estos estudios no se deben combinar. Diferentes inhibidores de proteasa pueden tener interacci&oacute;n y ser extremadamente peligrosos o mortales. Se espera que la informaci&oacute;n sobre estudios de inhibidores de proteasa combinados sea publicada en julio de 1996.</p>

<p>Otros inhibidores de proteasa est&aacute;n siendo investigados en <a href="../hiv.html">estudios cl&iacute;nicos</a>. AG-1343 (Viracept) es un inhibidor de proteasa producido por la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Agouron. Recientemente han comenzado nuevos estudios con este inhibidor de proteasa. Para obtener informaci&oacute;n sobre los estudios cl&iacute;nicos de inhibidores de proteasa que est&aacute;n abiertos a participantes, llame a la Red, al (800) 734-7104.</p>

<p><i>Los inhibidores de proteasa pueden afectar la absorci&oacute;n de otros medicamentos. Esto es lo que se conoce como interacci&oacute;n de medicamentos. Su proveedor de servicios de salud debe revisar junto a usted los medicamentos que puedan crear interacci&oacute;n, antes de comenzar a tomar el inhibidor de proteasa. Podr&iacute;a ser necesario que usted tenga que cambiar o alterar las dosis de ciertos medicamentos para asegurarse de que el inhibidor de proteasa funcione adecuadamente.</p>

<P>Interleucina-2 &oacute; IL-2, es una substancia que el cuerpo produce naturalmente para controlar la funci&oacute;n y el crecimiento de distintos tipos de c&eacute;lulas.  Algunas de estas c&eacute;lulas crean mensajes qu&iacute;micos, que se conocen como citoquinas.  Las citoquinas ayudan a combatir las infecciones.  El IL-2 ayuda al sistema inmunol&oacute;gico a producir c&eacute;lulas que se encarguen de eliminar las c&eacute;lulas infectadas o cancerosas.  Las c&eacute;lulas T necesitan el IL-2 para seguirse desarrollando.  Sin el IL-2 las c&eacute;lulas T auxiliares activadas mueren.</p> 

<p>Hace 10 a&ntilde;os, a las personas con SIDA se les daba IL-2 en dosis mucho m&aacute;s altas de las que est&aacute;n siendo estudiadas ahora.  Los resultados fueron desastrosos; la gente comenz&oacute; a enfermarse y a morir.  Como muchas de las personas con SIDA que tomaron el medicamento ya estaban muy enfermas, parec&iacute;a ser que el medicamento no ayudaba y hac&iacute;a que empeoraran.  Desde ese momento siguieron las investigaciones con el IL-2.  Aunque algunas personas quisieran hacer &eacute;nfasis en que el IL-2 tomado por cinco d&iacute;as cada dos meses, podr&iacute;a aumentar el tiempo de vida y aumentar significativamente el conteo de T4, todav&iacute;a no existe mucha evidencia de que esto pueda ocurrir.</p>

<p>En estudios anteriores realizados con IL-2, fue observado un aumento significativo de c&eacute;lulas T4 por un corto per&iacute;odo de tiempo y por el tiempo que el medicamento se sigui&oacute; usando.  Los efectos secundarios fueron muy t&oacute;xicos.  Se espera que la manera en que el medicamento est&aacute; siendo estudiado ahora pueda ayudar a evitar algunos de los efectos secundarios como la fiebre, los escalofr&iacute;os y el malestar general.  Los cient&iacute;ficos est&aacute;n revisando la manera en que el IL-2 es dado,  incluyendo cuanta cantidad, cuando y por cuanto tiempo.  En estudios realizados actualmente, est&aacute;n dando el medicamento por cinco d&iacute;as una vez al mes, en lugar de darlo diariamente.  Las dosis usadas son m&aacute;s bajas.  Quiz&aacute;s, esto pueda ayudar al sistema inmunol&oacute;gico a crear una respuesta m&aacute;s balanceada.</p>

<p>Estudios han mostrado un mayor beneficio de la terapia con IL-2 cuando los conteos de c&eacute;lulas T4 todav&iacute;a son altos y se sugiere que el uso de terapia antiretroviral junto al IL-2 puede ayudar a que se obtengan resultados positivos.  Seis meses despu&eacute;s de la primera infusi&oacute;n con IL-2, solamente ocho porciento de los participantes en el estudio con conteos de c&eacute;lulas T4 menor de 100, mantuvieron el doble de c&eacute;lulas T.  Entre los que ten&iacute;an m&aacute;s de 200 c&eacute;lulas T, apr&oacute;ximadamente un tercio mantuvieron este conteo.  Algunas personas han comenzado a inyectarse IL-2 por su propia cuenta, el IL-2 est&aacute; disponible por receta para personas que tienen c&aacute;ncer.  Esto es muy peligroso, no lo recomendamos.  Nosotros recomendamos la participaci&oacute;n de un profesional m&eacute;dico hasta que se sepa m&aacute;s sobre el IL-2; como puede ser mejor usado y qu&eacute; hace al sistema inmunol&oacute;gico.</p>

<P>Tambi&eacute;n recomendamos que la gente que est&aacute; considerando usar el medicamento tome en cuenta los riesgos y beneficios de usarlo.  Una forma sint&eacute;tica de IL-2 ha sido probada en dosis bajas y parece ser capaz de ayudar con la infecci&oacute;n del VIH.  Nuevos estudios investigar&aacute;n el IL-2 en dosis m&aacute;s altas.  En un estudio en el NIH se est&aacute; investigando el IL-2 para tratar la infecci&oacute;n del VIH y en otro, se est&aacute; investigando el IL-2 para tratar el KS.  Un estudio en diferentes lugares en el pa&iacute;s, incluyendo a Nueva York, investiga el IL-2 en combinaci&oacute;n con AZT para tratar la infecci&oacute;n del VIH.  Otro tratamiento, que todav&iacute;a es experimental,  est&aacute; usando terapia con genes e IL-2.  La terapia con genes usa tratamiento con versiones clonales de genes y puede ser usada para llevar IL-2 a un lugar espec&iacute;fico en el cuerpo, tal como a un tumor.  Usar la terapia con genes para llevar el IL-2 tiene un beneficio adicional y es que puede ser posible que evite los efectos t&oacute;xicos del IL-2.</p>

<P>Efectos secundarios del IL-2 incluyen n&aacute;usea, v&oacute;mitos, fiebre, escalofr&iacute;os, dolores de cabeza, dolor en los m&uacute;sculos, corta respiraci&oacute;n, baja presi&oacute;n y da&ntilde;o a los ri&ntilde;ones y al h&iacute;gado.  Algunos doctores est&aacute;n dando IL-2 en inyecci&oacute;n subcut&aacute;nea (bajo la piel), lo que muchas personas pueden hacer por si mismas en su casa.  Usted puede desarrollar ronchas grandes en el lugar de la inyecci&oacute;n, lo que ocasionalmente puede dejar n&oacute;dulos debajo de la piel.  Nunca se de un tratamiento sin la supervisi&oacute;n de un m&eacute;dico. </p>

<p>Los NNRTIs evitan que el VIH infecte nuevas c&eacute;lulas.  La transcripatasa inversa es una parte del VIH que &eacute;ste necesita para producir un nuevo virus e infectar m&aacute;s c&eacute;lulas.  Los NNRTIs evitan que la transcriptasa inversa funcione adecuadamente.</p>

<p>En estudios cl&iacute;nicos recientes sobre este tipo de medicamentos, se encontr&oacute; que el VIH desarrolla resistencia en poco tiempo, de dos a siete semanas, cuando los medicamentos son usados solos.  Actualmente, los medicamentos est&aacute;n siendo estudiados en combinaci&oacute;n con otros para evitar que el virus desarrolle resistencia y limitar los efectos secundarios vistos en los nuclwe&oacute;sidos an&aacute;logos.</p>

<p>La <b>nevirapina</b> es un NNRTI que ha sido usado en una serie de estudios cl&iacute;nicos.  Dosis altas de 200 mg/d&iacute;a de nevirapina han sido bien toleradas.  Los mayores efectos secundarios han sido fiebre, dolor muscular o sarpullido.  Los efectos secundarios hab&iacute;an sido m&aacute;s com&uacute;nmente vistos en los participantes que estaban tomando las dosis m&aacute;s altas.  M&aacute;s de la mitad de los participantes en el estudio que tomaron que tomaron una dosis de 400 mg al d&iacute;a, desarrollaron sarpullido.</p>

<p>La nevirapina fue capaz de causar una r&aacute;pida disminuci&oacute;n en la reproducci&oacute;n viral, seg&uacute;n medidas obtenidas del ant&iacute;geno p24, cuando fue usado solo.  Sin embargo, fue desarrollada resistencia al medicamento en tan s&oacute;lo dos semanas con la dosis de 200 mg diarios.  En la actualidad, se est&aacute; estudiando la nevirapina en combinaci&oacute;n con nucle&oacute;sidos an&aacute;logos en adultos, adolescentes y ni&ntilde;os.</p>

<p>La <b>delavirdina</b> es un NNRTI que ha demostrado ser bien absorbido por el cuerpo en estudios cl&iacute;nicos.  En tubos de ensayo parece ser de 50 a 100 veces m&aacute;s potente que la atevirdina, su pariente o compuesto descubierto primero.  La delavirdina ha bloqueado la replicaci&oacute;n de 25 diferentes cepas del HIV-1, incluyendo algunas resistentes al AZT y al ddI.  A&uacute;n as&iacute;, el efecto secundario mayormente visto a ra&iacute;z del uso de delavirdina, ha sido un sarpullido desarrollado entre 20% y 25% de los participantes.  Este efecto secundario puede ser reducido comenzando el tratamiento con dosis m&aacute;s bajas del medicamento, que sigan siendo aumentadas, poco a poco, hasta llegar a la dosis completa. </p>

<p>En dos estudios est&aacute; siendo estudiada la delavirdina en combinaci&oacute;n con otros tratamientos.  En el primer estudio est&aacute;n matriculando participantes que nunca hayan tomado AZT y que tengan un conteo de T de 300-500.  En este estudio, que consta de cuatro partes, ser&aacute; investigado el AZT, solo o en combinaci&oacute;n, con diferentes dosis de delavirdina tres veces al d&iacute;a.</p>

<p>El otro estudio con delavirdina ser&aacute; para personas que no toleran el AZT, y ser&aacute; estudiada la combinaci&oacute;n de delavirdina y ddI.  Los participantes deber&aacute;n tener menos de 300 c&eacute;lulas T y haber estado tomando ddI por menos de cuatro meses.</p>

<p><b>Lovirida</b> es un tercer NNRTI (inhibidores de transcriptasa inversa no-nucle&oacute;sidos).  En un estudio alem&aacute;n doble-ciego controlado con placebo, los pacientes VIH+ con conteos de CD4 mayor de 400 fueron agrupados al azar para recibir lovirida, el placebo &oacute; R18893 (un compuesto similar a lovirida).  Despu&eacute;s de 24 semanas de seguimiento, el grupo que estuvo tomando lovirida tuvo los mejores resultados de CD4, con un aumento promedio de aproximadamente 20% sobre el conteo al inicio del estudio.  Ninguna de las mutaciones conocidas que crean resistencia a lovirida fueron detectadas.  Nuevos estudios est&aacute;n siendo planificados con este compuesto.</p>

<p>Ning&uacute;n NNRTI ha sido aprobado para tratar la infecci&oacute;n del VIH.  Los medicamentos aqu&iacute; descritos est&aacute;n siendo investigados en estudios cl&iacute;nicos.

<p>Para obtener mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre otros tratamientos y sobre estudios cl&iacute;nicos que actualmente est&aacute;n abiertos a participantes, vea la p&aacute;gina de <A HREF="../hiv.html">estudios cl&iacute;nicos</a></p>

<hr size=3 width=50% align=center>

<p>Ritonavir (nombre de marca Norvir, tambi&eacute;n conocido como ABT-538) pertenece a un nuevo grupo de medicamentos contra el VIH, llamados <a href="protease.html">inhibidores de proteasa</a>. Estos medicamentos funcionan bloqueando una parte del VIH llamada proteasa. Cuando la proteasa es bloqueada, el VIH hace copias de s&iacute; mismo que no pueden infectar nuevas c&eacute;lulas. Hasta el momento, los inhibidores de proteasa parecen ser menos t&oacute;xicos y tener menos efectos secundarios que los medicamentos anteriormente aprobados contra el VIH (AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T y 3TC - estos medicamentos son llamados nucle&oacute;sidos an&aacute;logos).</p>

<p><b>Resultados de estudios</b><br>
En un estudio hecho con personas con menos de 100 c&eacute;lulas T4, se encontr&oacute; que ritonavir ayuda a la gente a vivir por m&aacute;s tiempo y a retrasar la progresi&oacute;n de la enfermedad. En este estudio participaron 1,090 personas y el conteo promedio de c&eacute;lulas T4 fue de alrededor de 30. A los participantes se les permiti&oacute; tomar cualquier medicamento aprobado contra el VIH mientras estuvieran en el estudio. Un grupo de participantes a&ntilde;adi&oacute; ritonavir a los medicamentos que estaban tomando y el otro grupo tom&oacute; el placebo.</p>

<p>Despu&eacute;s de un tiempo promedio de seis meses de seguimiento, 46 personas que estaban tomando el placebo murieron, comparado con 26 que murieron mientras usaban ritonavir. Esto quiere decir que para las personas que estaban tomando ritonavir el riesgo de morir fue grandemente reducido, casi a la mitad, comparado con quienes tomaron el placebo.</p>

<p>Los investigadores tambi&eacute;n observaron los resultados del estudio, tan solo un mes despu&eacute;s de haber comenzado. A este punto en el estudio, 149 personas que estaban tomando el placebo ya hab&iacute;an experimentado una nueva infecci&oacute;n oportunista o hab&iacute;an muerto, comparado con 69 personas que estaban tomando ritonavir. Esto parece demostrar que el medicamento puede tener efecto tan pronto alguien empieza a tomarlo.</p>

<p>Actualmente est&aacute;n siendo realizados otros estudios de ritonavir tomado en combinaci&oacute;n con otros medicamentos contra el VIH. En un estudio franc&eacute;s de ritonavir tomado en combinaci&oacute;n con AZT y ddC participaron 32 personas. Nadie hab&iacute;a tomado medicamentos contra el VIH anteriormente. El conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4 promedio fue de 156. Pasados seis meses, todav&iacute;a 21 personas permanec&iacute;an en el estudio y 11 hab&iacute;an dejado el estudio debido a los efectos secundarios. Despu&eacute;s de seis meses el conteo promedio de c&eacute;lulas T4 subi&oacute; a 303. La cantidad de virus en la sangre redujo de un promedio de 69,780 copias a 892.</p>

<p><b>Efectos secundarios</b><br>
Los mayores efectos secundarios vistos en estudios de ritonavir, fueron: n&aacute;usea, v&oacute;mitos, debilidad y diarrea. Otros efectos secundarios que han sido asociados al medicamento es una sensaci&oacute;n de adormecimiento alrededor de la boca y enzimas del h&iacute;gado altas.</p>

<p>Ahora que el medicamento ha sido aprobado, distintas personas que han estado tomando el medicamento est&aacute;n reportando que estos efectos secundarios pueden ser muy comunes y m&aacute;s severos de lo que se pensaba. Debido a &eacute;sto, la farmac&eacute;utica Abbott, ha recomendado que cuando una persona est&eacute; empezando a tomar el medicamento, aumente la dosis poco a poco hasta llegar a la dosis recomendada. Se podr&iacute;a comenzar tomando 300 mg dos veces al d&iacute;a, despu&eacute;s de varios d&iacute;as, aumentar a 400 mg dos veces al d&iacute;a y seguir as&iacute; hasta llegar a la dosis recomendada de 600 mg dos veces al d&iacute;a.</p>

<p>Es muy importante no tardar m&aacute;s de 14 d&iacute;as en llegar a la dosis recomendada, ya que el VIH podr&iacute;a crear resistencia al medicamento. Si usted no puede tomar la dosis completa, la dosis m&aacute;s baja que se puede tomar es de 500 mg dos veces al d&iacute;a y debe ser en combinaci&oacute;n con otros medicamentos contra el VIH.</p>

<p>El medicamento tambi&eacute;n debe ser tomado con comidas altas en prote&iacute;na y en grasa. En reportes anecd&oacute;ticos ha sido informado que tomar ritonavir con yogurt, justo despu&eacute;s de comer, puede ayudar a reducir los efectos secundarios. Si los efectos secundarios siguen y usted no puede tolerar el medicamento, podr&iacute;a considerar tomar otro inhibidor de proteasa, como indinavir (Crixivan) o saquinavir (Invirase). Puede llamar a la Red para obtener Hojas Sueltas sobre estos inhibidores de proteasa.</p>

<p><b>Interacci&oacute;n con otros medicamentos</b><br>
Ritonavir puede afectar la forma en que el cuerpo absorbe otros medicamentos. En la informaci&oacute;n que viene con ritonavir est&aacute; incluida una larga lista de medicamentos que son afectados por ritonavir. Es muy importante que si usted est&aacute; pensando tomar ritonavir, revise cuidadosamente esta lista con su proveedor de servicios de salud. Algunas de las interacciones de medicamentos podr&iacute;an ser mortales. Si usted necesita ayuda para saber cuales medicamentos crean interacci&oacute;n (algunos medicamentos tienen diferentes nombres), llame a la Red.</p>

<p>No todos los inhibidores de proteasa afectan la reacci&oacute;n de tantos medicamentos. Tambi&eacute;n, usted podr&iacute;a cambiar a otro medicamento que no tenga interacci&oacute;n, para poder tomar ritonavir.</p>

<p><b>Almacenamiento</b><br>
Ritonavir viene en forma de c&aacute;psula y en forma l&iacute;quida. Las c&aacute;psulas deben mantenerse refrigeradas y protegidas de la luz. Tambi&eacute;n se recomienda que la forma l&iacute;quida sea refrigerada, aunque no es necesario si se deja en un lugar que no sea caluroso y si se usa dentro de 30 d&iacute;as.</p>

<p><i>Estos son los medicamentos que NO deben ser administrados junto a ritonavir: amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, bupropion, cisapride, clozapine, encainide, flecainide, meperidine, piroxicam, propafenone, propoxyphene, quinidine, rifabutin y terfenadine. Lo mismo aplica a estos sedativos e hipn&oacute;ticos: alprazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, midazolam, triazolam y zolpidem. Abbott tiene disponible una l&iacute;nea especial de informaci&oacute;n para las personas que necesiten informaci&oacute;n en recetar ritonavir. El n&uacute;mero al que debe llamar es el (800) 441-4987.</i><p>

<p>Los Laboratorios Abbott, donde se produce ritonavir, han desarrollado <a href="../../access/pa/rito.html">un programa de ayuda al paciente</a> para las personas que tienen dificultad en pagar el medicamento. Para mayor informaci&oacute;n, llame al (800) 659-9050.</p>

<h2>Hojas Sueltas de <A HREF="../index.html">La Red</A></h2>

<blockquote><font size=-1>
<p>Para obtener mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre otros tratamientos y sobre estudios cl&iacute;nicos contra retinitis HIV que actualmente est&aacute;n abiertos a participantes, vea la p&aacute;gina de <A HREF="../hiv.html">estudios cl&iacute;nicos</a>.</p>

<hr size=3 width=50% align=center>

<p>Saquinavir (nombre de marca Invirase) es el primer <a href="protease.html">inhibidor de proteasa</a> que ha sido aprobado para tratar la infecci&oacute;n del VIH. Los inhibidores de proteasa son un nuevo tipo de medicamentos contra el VIH que bloquean una parte del virus llamada proteasa. De esta forma, las nuevas copias del virus resultan ser defectuosas y no pueden infectar nuevas c&eacute;lulas. Saquinavir ha sido aprobado para ser usado en combinaci&oacute;n con uno o m&aacute;s de los medicamentos nucle&oacute;sidos an&aacute;logos aprobados (AZT, ddI, d4T y 3TC), en personas con un conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4 menor de 300. La dosis recomendada del medicamento es de 600 mg tres veces al d&iacute;a.</p>

<p><b>Resultados de estudios</b><br>
En el estudio cl&iacute;nico m&aacute;s amplio que se hizo de saquinavir, las combinaciones de medicamentos que se investigaron, fueron; saquinavir/AZT, saquinavir/AZT/ddC y AZT/ddC. Despu&eacute;s de 48 semanas de tratamiento los participantes que estaban tomando saquinavir/AZTy ddC tuvieron un aumento promedio de 111 c&eacute;lulas T4. Aquellos que tomaron saquinavir/AZT, tuvieron un aumento promedio de 74 c&eacute;lulas T4 y quienes tomaron AZT y ddC, tuvieron un aumento promedio de 72 c&eacute;lulas T4.</p>

<p>En un estudio reciente fue estudiada la combinaci&oacute;n de saquinavir y ddC (nombre de marca HIVID) con saquinavir o ddC solos. El conteo promedio de c&eacute;lulas T4 de los participantes era de 160-180. En este estudio la combinaci&oacute;n saquinavir/ddC redujo el nivel de mortalidad por dos tercios - hubo 28 muertes entre quienes tomaron ddC, 34 con saquinavir y 9 con la combinaci&oacute;n.</p>

<p><b>Resistencia</b><br>
En los estudios tambi&eacute;n ha quedado demostrado que el VIH puede desarrollar resistencia contra saquinavir. Esto ocurre debido a que el VIH produce copias de s&iacute; mismo todo el tiempo y cada nuevo virus del VIH puede ser ligeramente diferente al anterior. As&iacute; mismo, la proteasa del nuevo virus puede ser ligeramente diferente a la anterior y puede ser que saquinavir no tenga ning&uacute;n efecto en la nueva proteasa que el virus ha producido. Existen dos tipos de cambio, llamados mutaciones, que saquinavir puede causar en la proteasa del VIH. En el estudio cl&iacute;nico m&aacute;s amplio realizado hasta ahora, menos de la mitad de los participantes ten&iacute;an una de estas mutaciones resistentes del VIH, despu&eacute;s de haber tomado saquinavir por un a&ntilde;o. Una de las mutaciones puede hacer que el VIH cree resistencia, un poco m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil, a otros inhibidores de proteasa, pero &eacute;sto todav&iacute;a no se sabe con certeza. Esta informaci&oacute;n proviene de estudios realizados en tubos de ensayo; solamente a trav&eacute;s de estudios cl&iacute;nicos hechos en personas podr&aacute; ser contestada esta pregunta.</p>

<p><b>Absorci&oacute;n</b><br>
La f&oacute;rmula actual de saquinavir no es muy bien absorbida por el cuerpo. En un peque&ntilde;o estudio realizado en California, qued&oacute; demostrado que el medicamento podr&iacute;a ser m&aacute;s efectivo contra el VIH cuando es tomado en dosis m&aacute;s altas. Sin embargo, las dosis usadas en este estudio podr&iacute;an ser muy costosas. Una nueva versi&oacute;n del medicamento, que se espera sea mejor absorbida, est&aacute; siendo estudiada. Esta nueva versi&oacute;n de saquinavir substituir&aacute; a la actual p&iacute;ldora, cuando el estudio se haya completado.</p>

<p>En estudios, tambi&eacute;n se han estado investigando formas que puedan ayudar al cuerpo a absorber mejor saquinavir. Es altamente recomendable que el medicamento sea tomado despu&eacute;s de las comidas. En un peque&ntilde;o estudio se demostr&oacute; que el jugo de toronja concentrado congelado, puede ayudar a aumentar los niveles de saquinavir en el cuerpo. Los participantes en el estudio tomaron un peque&ntilde;o vaso (150ml) de jugo de toronja con saquinavir, seguido de otro vaso del mismo jugo una hora m&aacute;s tarde. En estos participantes, los niveles del medicamento aumentaron alrededor de 50%. Cuando hicieron el jugo de toronja m&aacute;s fuerte, esto es, mezcl&aacute;ndolo con la mitad de agua que usaron en el jugo anterior, el nivel de saquinavir en el cuerpo se duplic&oacute;. Tomar saquinavir con jugo de toronja para aumentar los niveles de saquinavir en el cuerpo puede causar complicaciones. El jugo de toronja podr&iacute;a afectar la absorci&oacute;n de otros medicamentos que usted est&eacute; tomando, lo que puede ser peligroso. La acidez del jugo de toronja tambi&eacute;n podr&iacute;a irritar el est&oacute;mago. Si Ud. est&aacute; considerando tomar jugo de toronja para aumentar los niveles de saquinavir en su cuerpo, disc&uacute;talo con su proveedor de servicios de salud.</p>

<p><b>Interacci&oacute;n con otros medicamentos</b><br>
Los antibi&oacute;ticos rifampin y rifabutin (Mycobutin) pueden reducir grandemente la cantidad de saquinavir en el cuerpo. Si usted va a tomar saquinavir, se recomienda que utilice otros medicamentos que sustituyan a estos antibi&oacute;ticos. El medicamento contra hongos, ketoconazole, aumenta ligeramente la cantidad de saquinavir en el cuerpo.</p>

<p><i><b>Efectos secundarios</b><br>
Saquinavir parece tener menos efectos secundarios que los nucle&oacute;sidos an&aacute;logos. En los estudios realizados, los efectos secundarios m&aacute;s comunes, vistos en pocas personas, fueron; diarrea, malestar estomacal y n&aacute;usea.</i></p>

<p>Hoffman-LaRoche, la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a que produce saquinavir, ha desarrollado un <a href="../../access/pa/saqu.html">programa de ayuda al paciente</a> para personas que necesitan ayuda en obtener el medicamento. El n&uacute;mero de tel&eacute;fono al que debe llamar, de lunes a viernes entre 9:00 AM y 8:00 PM, es el (800) 282-7780.</p>

<p>El tratamiento contra el VIH que sigue siendo m&aacute;s recetado es el AZT (nombre de marca Retrovir), aunque existen otros medicamentos que est&aacute;n disponibles contra el VIH; incluyendo ddI (Videx), ddC (Hivid), d4T (Zerit), 3TC (Epivir). Adem&aacute;s, el medicamento contra el VIH llamado 3TC (lamivudina, Epivir) est&aacute; disponible a trav&eacute;s de un programa nacional de Acceso Extendido. En estudios cl&iacute;nicos recientemente concluidos, qued&oacute; demostrado, que tomar AZT en combinaci&oacute;n con otro medicamento contra el VIH, como ddI o ddC, es m&aacute;s efectivo que tomar AZT solo.</p>

<p><b>El Estudio Delta</b><br>
En el estudio Delta fueron incluidos m&aacute;s de 3,000 participantes.  Los mismos, ten&iacute;an conteos de c&eacute;lulas T entre 50 y 350. Los medicamentos dados fueron AZT solo, AZT y ddI &oacute; AZT y ddC.  Los participantes en el estudio Delta fueron divididos en dos grupos: Delta 1 y Delta 2.  Alrededor de dos tercios de todos los participantes en el estudio nunca hab&iacute;an tomado AZT, &eacute;stos formaron parte del grupo 1 del estudio. En Delta 1, las combinaciones de AZT + ddI y de AZT + ddC fueron  mucho m&aacute;s efectivas que el uso de AZT solo, en evitar el desarrollo de nuevos s&iacute;ntomas y la mortalidad en los pacientes. El nivel de mortalidad fue reducido a 38% (m&aacute;s de un tercio), en los participantes del grupo Delta 1 que estuvieron recibiendo los medicamentos combinados, comparado con quienes estuvieron recibiendo el AZT solo.  Los participantes en el grupo Delta 2 hab&iacute;an estado tomando AZT anteriormente. En este grupo, no hubo diferencias significativas entre los participantes que tomaron AZT solo y los que tomaron la combinaci&oacute;n de medicamentos. En ambos grupos, la terapia combinada mostr&oacute; no tener la misma tendencia a causar efectos secundarios graves, como la terapia con AZT solo. A ra&iacute;z de los resultados del estudio Delta, el gobierno de Francia ha recomendado que se acepte recetar la terapia combinada en todos los hospitales del pa&iacute;s.</p>

<p><b>El estudio ACTG 175</b><br>
El segundo estudio cl&iacute;nico de terapia combinada (ACTG 175) fue realizado en los Estados Unidos. En &eacute;ste, fueron incluidos 2.467 participantes con conteos de c&eacute;lulas T entre 200 y 500. Los investigadores dieron seguimiento a los participantes por un tiempo promedio de tres a&ntilde;os. &Eacute;stos fueron asignados, al azar, en uno de cuatro tratamientos.  El primer grupo tom&oacute; AZT solo; el segundo, tom&oacute; AZT+ ddI; el tercero, AZT + ddC; y el cuarto, tom&oacute; ddI solo.  Cuando los investigadores observaron los  resultados generales del estudio,  encontraron que AZT + ddI y ddI solo, produjeron mejores resultados que el uso de AZT solo, al evitar un diagn&oacute;stico de SIDA y la muerte. A diferencia del estudio Delta, los beneficios de tomar AZT + ddI o ddI solo, fueron m&aacute;s claramente vistos en los participantes que ya hab&iacute;an estado tomando AZT.  Debido a que ninguno de los participantes en el estudio DELTA tomaron ddI solo, el estudio ACTG 175 todav&iacute;a deja algunas preguntas sin contestar sobre los beneficios del uso de ddI.  Este estudio, si demuestra claramente, que tomar la terapia combinada (AZT+ ddI o AZT + ddC) es m&aacute;s efectivo que tomar AZT solo. Un poco menos de la mitad de los participantes en el ACTG 175, nunca antes hab&iacute;an tomado AZT. En este grupo no hubo suficientes casos de personas que estuvieran desarollando el SIDA, por lo que no se pudo determinar c&uacute;al medicamento o combinaci&oacute;n de medicamentos es m&aacute;s efectivo en personas que est&aacute;n comenzando alguna terapia contra el VIH. Los resultados del estudio Delta proveyeron mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre este aspecto. En el estudio ACTG 175, la combinaci&oacute;n de AZT + ddI caus&oacute;, levemente, mayores efectos secundarios que el uso de AZT &oacute; ddI solos, o de AZT + ddC.</p>

<p><b>Ambos Estudios</b><br>
Muchos investigadores y m&eacute;dicos piensan que los resultados del estudio Delta muestran la mejor y m&aacute;s confiable evidencia de los beneficios de la terapia combinada versus la monoterapia. &Eacute;sto se debe a que en el estudio Delta pocas personas dejaron de  participar o dejaron de tomar los medicamentos antes de que terminara el estudio.  Alrededor de la mitad de los participantes que comenzaron en el ACTG 175, dejaron de participar o descontinuaron los medicamentos antes de que terminara el estudio.  El estudio Delta demostr&oacute; que las personas que nunca han recibido terapia contra el VIH, se benefician m&aacute;s de comenzar el tratamiento con la terapia combinada.  En el ACTG 175, las personas que hab&iacute;an estado tomando AZT antes, se beneficiaron m&aacute;s de tomar AZT y ddI &oacute; ddI solo. Ninguno de los dos estudios fue dise&ntilde;ado para estudiar cuando las personas deben comenzar a recibir la terapia contra el VIH. Sin embargo, es alentador saber que todas las personas en el estudio Delta con conteos de c&eacute;lulas T entre 50 y 350, parecieron benificiarse de la terapia combinada, aunque ya tuvieran s&iacute;ntomas o un diagn&oacute;stico de SIDA.</p>

<p><b>3TC y AZT</b><br>
3TC, en combinaci&oacute;n con AZT,fue aprobado por la FDA (Administraci&oacute;n de Alimentos y Medicamentos) en noviembre de 1995. Pronto habr&aacute; disponible mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre los estudios cl&iacute;nicos donde se est&aacute; usando el AZT en combinaci&oacute;n con 3TC.  &Eacute;stos demuestran que el aumento y disminuci&oacute;n de las c&eacute;lulas T en la cantidad del VIH en la sangre de los participantes, ha durado por m&aacute;s de 2 a&ntilde;os. Para mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre 3TC y AZT, los doctores pueden llamar a Glaxo-Wellcome, al 1 (800) 248-9757.</p>

<h2>Hojas Sueltas de <A HREF="../index.html">La Red</A></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><font size=-1>Para obtener mayor informaci&oacute;n sobre otros tratamientos y sobre estudios cl&iacute;nicos que actualmente est&aacute;n abiertos a participantes, vea la p&aacute;gina de <A HREF="../hiv.html">estudios cl&iacute;nicos</a> <i>(en ingl&eacute;s)</i>.</font></p>

<p>La talidomida fue prohibida a comienzos de los a&ntilde;os ‘60, despu&eacute;s de haberse descubierto que causaba deformaciones en las extremidades de los ni&ntilde;os de mujeres que la tomaban durante la primera etapa del embarazo.  El medicamento est&aacute; siendo investigado ahora para tratar el SIDA, la tuberculosis y otras enfermedades.</p>

<p>Los investigadores han encontrado que la talidomida puede inhibir el crecimiento del VIH en tubos de ensayo.  La talidomida fue efectiva en pruebas de laboratorio contra el VIH al suprimir una substancia natural producida en el cuerpo.  Esta substancia es llamada factor de necrosis del tumor  (TNF), tambi&eacute;n conocido como caquectina.  El TNF es liberado por las c&eacute;lulas blancas durante la infecci&oacute;n y ayuda a atacar los organismos invasores.  En algunas personas con la infecci&oacute;n del VIH, la producci&oacute;n de TNF es alta.  Niveles altos de TNF est&aacute;n asociados con una progresi&oacute;n m&aacute;s r&aacute;pida del SIDA y con el desarrollo de la enfermedad del sistema nervioso central asociada al VIH.  La producci&oacute;n excesiva de TNF durante un per&iacute;odo de tiempo puede llevar a p&eacute;rdida de peso y/o a interferir con la capacidad del sistema inmunol&oacute;gico para combatir infecciones.</p>

<p>En un estudio peque&ntilde;o, se encontr&oacute; que el tratamiento con talidomida puede ayudar en la p&eacute;rdida de peso severa en personas con SIDA.  Los investigadores concluyeron que la talidomida tiene un efecto beneficioso en los s&iacute;ntomas que constituyen el s&iacute;ndrome de desgaste, pero no aument&oacute; el conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4 o redujo la replicaci&oacute;n del VIH en estos pacientes.</p>

<p>La compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de medicamentos que hace la talidomida es Celgene.  Su nombre de marca es Synovir.  Celgene est&aacute; auspiciando un estudio de Fase II con placebo y dos niveles de dosis de Synovir.  El estudio investigar&aacute; cuan bien talidomida ayuda a promover el aumento de peso.  Adem&aacute;s, ser&aacute; evaluada una cantidad de indicadores inmunol&oacute;gicos y virales para ver si Synovir afecta la funci&oacute;n del VIH y del sistema inmunol&oacute;gico.</p>

<p>Los participantes ser&aacute;n divididos en tres grupos.  Un grupo tomar&aacute; 100 mg de talidomida diariamente.  El segundo grupo tomar&aacute; 200 mg diarios de talidomida.  El tercer grupo tomar&aacute; el placebo.  Talidomida ser&aacute; dado en p&iacute;ldora.  Ni los participantes ni el doctor sabr&aacute;n el medicamento dado.</p>

<p>Para participar en este estudio usted debe ser VIH+, tener 18 a&ntilde;os de edad o m&aacute;s,  posmenopa&uacute;sica, si es mujer, y haber perdido peso, tener fiebres o sudores nocturnos.  Si su conteo de c&eacute;lulas T4 es menor de 500, debe estar en dosis estable de AZT o ddI, por lo menos un mes antes del estudio.  Los participantes en el estudio han reportado haber obtenido buenos resultados, especialmente en controlar el desgaste, aumentar de peso y adelgazar la composici&oacute;n del cuerpo.  La dosis usada por algunas personas con SIDA en Estados Unidos es de 100 a 300 mg/d&iacute;a, y se sugiere tomar el medicamento tarde en la tarde o en la noche. </p>

<p>El Grupo de Estudios Cl&iacute;nicos sobre el SIDA (ACTG) est&aacute; realizando un estudio para investigar la talidomida como un tratamiento para las &uacute;lceras de la boca en personas con la infecci&oacute;n del VIH.  Los participantes ser&aacute;n divididos en dos grupos.  Un grupo tomar&aacute; talidomida y el otro tomar&aacute; el placebo.  Despu&eacute;s de 4 semanas, si no se observa ninguna mejor&iacute;a, el grupo que est&aacute; tomando talidomida tomar&aacute; una dosis m&aacute;s alta y el grupo que est&aacute; tomando el placebo tomar&aacute; talidomida.  Debido a los serios efectos secundarios de talidomida, las mujeres deber&aacute;n usar un m&eacute;todo qu&iacute;mico de control del embarazo, tal como la p&iacute;ldora, adem&aacute;s de un m&eacute;todo que sirva como barrera de control del embarazo, tal como el cond&oacute;n.  Se har&aacute;n pruebas de embarazo semanales y durante cuatro semanas despu&eacute;s que termine el estudio.  Todos los hombres deben estar de acuerdo en practicar la abstinencia o en usar condones.</p>

<p>Para participar en este estudio usted debe ser VIH+, tener 13 a&ntilde;os de edad o m&aacute;s y haberse hecho una biopsia que confirme &uacute;lceras de afta en el es&oacute;fago o en la boca, por lo menos dos semanas antes del estudio.  Debe tener un cultivo negativo de herpes ulcerativo.</p>

<p>La talidomida fue desarrollada durante la d&eacute;cada de los a&ntilde;os ‘50 para prevenir la na&uacute;sea durante el embarazo, pero se encontr&oacute; que produc&iacute;a anormalidades en las extremidades del feto.</p>

<p>Recientemente se ha descubierto que tambi&eacute;n inhibe la replicaci&oacute;n del VIH y sana las &uacute;lceras de c&aacute;ncer en pacientes con SIDA y otras condiciones.  Adem&aacute;s, la talidomida es usada para tratar algunos s&iacute;ntomas de la enfermedad de Hansen o la lepra.</p>

<dt><b><a name="a">A</a></b>

<dt>ABT-538: <dd>Inhibidor de proteasa hecho por Abbott. Actualmente est&aacute siendo estudiado en pruebas cl&iacute;nicas. Puede causar problemas del h&iacute;gado y en los ojos.

<dt>ABV: <dd>Este tratamiento de quimioterapia, normalmente usado para el c&aacutencer, combina los siguientes medicamentos: adriamicina, bleomicina y vincristina. Es dado en inyecci&oacute;n directamente en la vena.

<dt>aciclovir, acyclovir (Zovirax): <dd>Fue aprobado para el tratamiento del herpes. Este tratamiento es suministrado por v&iacute;a oral o en inyecci&oacute;n. Se ha comprobado que el aciclovir tiene un historial de toxicidad aceptable. Puede causar malestar estomacal, dolor de cabeza o n&aacuteusea. Se han reportado casos de p&eacute;rdida del cabello por el uso prolongado de este medicamento.

<dt>&aacutecido retinoico "all-trans", all-trans retinoic acid: <dd>&aacutecido natural derivado de la vitamina A. Ha demostrado que puede detener el crecimiento de c&eacute;lulas cancerosas. Est&aacute siendo estudiado para el tratamiento del KS. 

<dt>acitretina, acitretin : <dd>Est&aacute siendo estudiado para el tratamiento de la psoriasis asociada al VIH. Es derivado de etretinate, un tratamiento que ha probado ser efectivo contra la psoriasis. El periodo de efectividad del acitretin es de dos a tres d&iacute;as, mientras que el de etretinate es de 100 d&iacute;as.

<dt>adriamicina, adriamycin: <dd>Vea doxorubicina.

<dt>albendazol, albendazole: <dd>Est&aacute siendo estudiado para el tratamiento de la criptosporidiosis. Es una pastilla. Efectos secundarios pueden incluir: malestar estomacal, dolor de cabeza y mareos.

<dt>ALT: <dd>Aminotransferasa de alanina. Vea SGPT.

<dt>amikacina, amikacin : <dd>Antibi&oacute;tico aprobado. Est&aacute siendo estudiado en combinaci&oacute;n con otros medicamentos para el tratamiento del MAC. Efectos secundarios incluyen da&ntildeo al ri&ntilde&oacute;n y p&eacute;rdida de audici&oacute;n.

<dt>amitriptilina, amitryptiline (Amitril, Elavil): <dd>Para el tratamiento de la depresi&oacute;n. Tambi&eacute;n utilizado para la neuropat&iacute;a perif&eacute;rica.

<dt>an&aacutelogo nucle&oacute;sido, nucleoside analog: <dd>Una copia artificial de un nucle&oacute;sido (base que forma el ADN). Cuando el nucle&oacute;sido an&aacutelogo se incorpora en el ADN del virus durante la reproducci&oacute;n viral, actœa evitando la producci&oacute;n del nuevo virus. Los nucle&oacute;sidos an&aacutelogos tambi&eacute;n pueden inhibir la producci&oacute;n del ADN en c&eacute;lulas saludables. Los no nucle&oacute;sidos son medicamentos que inhiben el virus sin usar este mecanismo.

<dt>Anfocil, Amphocil: <dd>Una preparaci&oacute;n liposomal de anfotericina B. Un liposoma es una peque&ntildea burbuja de grasa que puede ayudar a dirigir el medicamento al tejido enfermo. Puede tener pocos efectos secundarios. Tratamiento para infecciones causadas por hongos.

<dt>anfotericina B, amphotericin B: <dd>Antibi&oacute;tico usado en el tratamiento de la meningitis criptococa. Es suministrado intravenosamente. Fuertes efectos secundarios incluyen: fiebres, escalofr&iacute;os, dolor de cabeza, anorexia, n&aacuteusea, v&oacute;mitos, diarrea, da&ntildeo al ri&ntilde&oacute;n y supresi&oacute;n de la producci&oacute;n de la m&eacute;dula &oacute;sea. Este medicamento est&aacute disponible en forma de p&iacute;ldora por medio de grupos de compradores, "buyer&iacute;s club"(grupos que compran medicamentos).

<dt>anti-B4 ricina bloqueada, anti-B4 blocked ricin: <dd>Tratamiento contra linfomas. Anti-B4 es un anticuerpo monoclonal enlazado con la toxina de una planta (ricina). Al bloquear la ricina se evita que &eacute;sta se una a m&aacutes c&eacute;lulas, mientras el anticuerpo anti-B4 ataca la mol&eacute;cula de las c&eacute;lulas B malignas. Puede afectar el h&iacute;gado. Otros efectos secundarios pueden ser reacciones al&eacute;rgicas y aumento de peso.

<H3><A NAME="Understanding">Understanding Drug Trials</A></H3>

<H4>What is a drug trial?</H4>

A drug trial is a carefully controlled experiment in which people take a drug to find out if it works and if it is safe. Drug trials are also called clinical trials or studies.<P>
 

The effects of the drugs being tested in trials are not known. It's important to be aware of the risks, as well as any possible benefits of participating in a clinical trial. Every drug trial is different, so it's important to find out exactly what might be expected to happen before you join.<P>


<H4>Why are drug trials done?</H4>

There aren't many approved drugs that fight AIDS and HIV, but there are a number of drugs that might work. Drug trials are done to find out which ones actually work, and which ones don't. If drugs are sold without being tested, the only information about the drug will come from unproven stories, or from the company that makes the drug. Drugs might be advertised and sold without proof that they work or are safe.<P>


<H4>Why can't I just take the drug I want?</H4>

Every drug sold in the US must first be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA carefully reviews the information from drug trials to determine that the drug is safe and that it works. If the drug is safe and effective, the FDA gives permission for the drug company to sell it. It is usually against the law to sell a drug if it has not been approved by the FDA. An insurance company, Medicaid, Medicare or the New York State AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) usually will not pay for a drug or treatment that has not been reviewed and approved by the FDA.<P>


<H4>Phase I: Is the drug safe?</H4>

A Phase I trial is usually the first time a new drug is given to people. This type of trial is done to find out if the drug is safe for people to take. Everyone in a Phase I trial gets some of the drug, but since most Phase I trials also try to find out what the best dose (amount) of the drug is, people are often given different doses. A drug in a Phase I trial has not been tested in many people, so very little is known about it. This makes Phase I trials riskier than Phase II or Phase III trials. Phase I trials are short, usually less than 2 or 3 months long, and usually involve under a hundred people. Phase I trials usually study how safe a drug is, but they may also look at how the drug affects the body.<P>

<H4>Phase II: Does it work?</H4>

If a Phase I trial finds that the drug is safe enough, a Phase II trial will be done. In a Phase II trial more people are given the drug to see if it works and to study the side effects more carefully. In this type of trial, researchers try to find out if the drug has a good effect. Phase II trials can last from a few months to a few years. There may be hundreds of people in a Phase II trial. In Phase II trials there are still risks that go along with possible benefits.<P>


<H4>Phase III: What if many people take it?</H4>

If the Phase II trial shows that the drug seems to work, a Phase III trial is started. In this type of trial, many people, sometimes thousands, are given the drug to see how well it works. Researchers look for rare side effects which are typically only seen in a few people. Drugs for life-threatening illnesses such as AIDS may be approved after Phase II trials. The drug company that owns the drug is then expected to conduct the Phase III trials after the drug is already approved. Sometimes phases are combined, and you will see a trial described as Phase I/II or Phase II/III. For some drugs, this speeds up the drug testing process.<P>


<H4>Will I know what drug I'm taking?</H4>

Not always. In a Phase I trial, you'll know what drug you're taking and how much. In a Phase II or III trial you probably won't know what drug you're taking. Phase II and III trials are usually controlled trials, and people in these trials are divided, by chance, into different groups. Each group takes either the new drug, an approved drug, or a placebo.<P>


The groups taking an approved drug or placebo are called "control" groups. Usually no one, not even the people running the trial, knows who is taking what until the trial is over. This is called a Double-Blind study. If everyone knows who is taking which drug, the trial is called an Open-Label study.<P>


A placebo is a fake pill or shot. Trials use placebos so the researchers can be certain any benefits or side effects seen are due to the drug and not some other cause.<P>


Controlled trials are done to make sure the drug really works. If everyone in a trial gets the new drug, there's no way to tell if the drug is making them better or if something else is doing it. They may get better because they're seeing a doctor for the first time, or because they're eating better and taking better care of themselves. So, a new drug is compared to something else or nothing, to see which is better.<P>


<H4>Will I get a placebo?</H4>

That depends on the trial. You might be given a placebo and nothing else if no approved treatment exists. If a trial is testing a drug to fight the opportunistic infection called cryptosporidiosis, some people might get a placebo and nothing else, because there is no approved treatment for cryptosporidiosis. But this won't happen if there is an approved treatment for your condition. Then you would either get the new drug or the approved drug.<P>
 

Some trials test drugs to see if they can prevent illness. In these trials, some of the people might be given a placebo and nothing else. Because some drugs are now being tested in combination, one or more pills or shots in the trial might be a placebo. For example, one group would get a new drug and AZT. The other group would get a placebo & AZT. If you are thinking of being part of a trial in which you might be given a placebo, ask if you will be able to get the treatment after the trial is over. Still, this does not mean that the new drug will work.<P>


If the people in the trial believe they're taking a drug that works, they may feel better even if the drug doesn't work. For example, in one trial that tested a drug to fight diarrhea, half of the people taking the new drug got better, but almost half of the people taking the placebo got better, too. This means the drug didn't work any better than a sugar pill.<P>


<H4>Why would I want be in a trial?</H4>

Joining a trial of an experimental drug is a serious decision. Discuss the trial with your doctor and other health care providers, and with people who have been involved in drug trials themselves. Always find out if there are trials at other places, or trials of other drugs that may be better for your situation. The list on the left side of this page gives reasons why you might want to join a trial.<P>
 

<H4>What else should I know?</H4>

You must carefully weigh the benefits you might receive against the risks you might be taking before making your decision to join a drug trial. If the trial is placebo-controlled, one of the risks you are taking is not getting any treatment at all. On the other hand, the experimental drug you might receive could potentially harm you.<P>


If you are kept out of a trial because of your race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, sex, age, sexual orientation, hemophilia, or history of drug use, you can file a discrimination complaint with a local Human Rights Agency.<P>
 

If a trial site wants you to leave your doctor and be the only place you go for health care, you will want to consider this carefully. This is not a requirement. You might want to continue your relationship with your doctor. Going to a doctor in one place and a trial site somewhere else can be tiring. Conserving your energy is very important. You may also have to take time off from work, or come up with extra money for transportation to take part in a trial. Ask the trial coordinator if there is transportation available, or money for other needs you might have.<P>


You will be carefully monitored during the trial. The trial doctor should coordinate your health care with your regular doctor. Make sure that you and your doctor get copies of all blood tests done while you are taking part in a trial, and that you discuss all side effects you experience with your doctor. Sometimes, however, researchers are not permitted to look at the results of blood tests until everyone in the trial has reached a certain point in the trial. If this is the case, the protocol for the trial will state when the results of such tests can be looked at, and when you can see them as well.<P>
 

Sometimes the Institutional Review Board (IRB), which is responsible for overseeing the trial and protecting the participants, may decide to change a trial because of data gathered so far. If unacceptable side effects are observed, the trial itself may be stopped.<P>

<H4>How do I find a trial?</H4>

The toll-free Network number is 1-800-734-7104. Not-for-profit organizations like The Network maintain up-to-date information about drug trials and treatment programs. Call The Network both to find out about a trial and to discuss information about a trial you are considering joining before you agree to participate. Your doctor may also know about drug trials, and suggest a specific trial. Some clinics run clinical trials. They have information about the trials they are doing. You can also call The New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute Treatment InfoLine at 1-800-MEDS-4-HIV, or the national information number for the AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service (ACTIS) at 1-800-TRIALSA.<P>


<H4>How do I join a trial?</H4>

Every trial has strict rules about who can join. The requirements of a trial are called Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Examples of inclusion criteria are having a T cell count of over 200 or being older than 13. Exclusion criteria are things that will keep you out of a trial, such as medications that you can't take while you are on the trial.<P>
 

When you find a trial that interests you, the first step is to call the trial site. The coordinator will ask you questions. If you meet the basic requirements of the trial, they will arrange for you to visit the site for an interview. During the interview, you'll be asked detailed questions about your health. A medical exam and some blood tests are also usually done.<P>
 

<H4>What's it like to be in a trial?</H4>

Every trial is different, so it's important to learn exactly what a trial requires before you join it. Everything you have to do while you're in the trial should be carefully explained to you. For example, you may be asked to write down information at home about your daily activities, or you may be told not to eat certain foods. If you think you might need help doing any of these things, ask for it. You should also know the reasons why you might be asked to leave the trial. How often do I go to the site?<P>


You may have to visit the site as little as once a month or as often as five times a week. At first, there may be many medical checkups to see what the drug is doing to you. Later in the trial there will usually be fewer checkups. Ask for a schedule so you remember your appointments.<P>


<H4>Will it cost me anything?</H4>

The drugs used in trials are given free, but many trial sites will want your insurance company or Medicaid to pay for lab tests. You may be billed for being screened for a trial. If you don't want your insurance company to know you're in a drug trial, talk about this with the people running the trial. If you don't have Medicaid or insurance, the site may pay for everything or may want you to pay. Check with different sites to see what the costs will be before you agree to an interview. Get the name and phone number of everyone you talk to.<P>


There may be other costs, like time off from work, subway fares, or babysitter and daycare costs. Some sites will pay for these, and some will not. Since the same trial may be done at a number of sites in your area, look around for the site that is best for you.<P>


<H4>Do I need my own doctor?</H4>

Yes. Joining a drug trial is not the same as having your own doctor. Drug trials are not designed to provide people with treatment, so it's important that you have a regular doctor or clinic for regular checkups and lab tests while you are in the trial.<P>
 

<H4>Who's in charge of the trial?</H4>

The person in charge of the drug trial at each site is called the principal investigator. The investigator is usually a doctor, although he or she could be a nurse or other clinical researcher. There is a team of doctors and nurses who do the medical exams and the blood tests, etc.<P>


<H4>What if I get sick while I'm in the trial?</H4>

If your health gets worse while you're in the trial, the people running the trial will try to find out if the drug is making you sick or if you're sick for some other reason. Keep your doctor informed about everything you are experiencing. Some drugs have side effects, like headaches or stomachaches. Some drugs can lead to serious illness or death. If you get sick because of the drug, tell the people running the trial. You may either be taken off the drug or be given a different amount. If the trial is comparing two drugs, you may be offered the other drug.<P>
 

If you get sick, but not because of the drug, you may have to leave the trial. It's important to get the phone number of a doctor or nurse involved with the trial who you can call 24 hours a day, in case you get sick in the middle of the night. Because the drugs in trials are experimental, a doctor in an emergency room may not know what to do if the drug makes you sick. Ask how you can be prepared if this happens.<P>
 

<H4>Know the answers:</H4>

A trial could last from a few days to a few years. Find out how long the trial is. In a Phase I trial, you probably will know what drug you are getting. In a Phase II, you might not.<P>
 

Find out who you can call for help 24 hours a day if you get sick. Ask ahead of time just in case it happens.<P>
 

It's important to go to your doctor for regular checkups. Ask if the trial site will help you find a doctor if you don't already have one.<P>

<H4>How will I take the drug?</H4>

In most trials you will take the drug at home. You will be told exactly when and how to take it. In other trials, you may have to take it in the hospital. A drug may be given in one of several ways:<P>
 

<UL><LI>Intramuscular (injected into a muscle)

<LI>Intravenous (injected into a vein) 

<LI>Subcutaneous (injected under the skin) 

<LI>A pill or liquid that you swallow 

<LI>A spray you breathe in 

<LI>A cream you rub on
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="Informed">Informed Consent and Safety</A></H3>

<H4>What is Informed Consent?</H4>

At the first visit you will be asked to give your informed consent to join the trial. Informed Consent means that after being informed of all the possible risks and benefits of the trial, you consent (agree) to join. The Informed Consent Form explains the rules of the trial in plain terms. It should be in your language. Otherwise, the trial site should provide an interpreter to explain it to you.<P>
 

Be sure that you understand and agree with everything about the trial before you sign this form. Keep a copy for yourself. Even if you sign, you can still leave the trial whenever you want and for any reason. If a child is joining a trial, the parent or guardian will be asked to sign the form, stating that all the risks and benefits for the child are understood. Joining a drug trial means that you agree to follow the rules of the trial. The rules of the trial are called a protocol, which explains exactly how the trial will be run. If you don't feel comfortable with the rules - like not being able to make all the appointments, or going to a clinic where the waiting room is full of sick people - talk to the people running the trial.<P>
 

<H4>Who protects me when I'm on a trial?</H4>

Every institution that conducts medical research involving people is required by the federal government to have an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB is a group of people from various professions who are responsible for protecting the rights of people in a trial. The IRB must approve any trial being done at that institution, and reviews the trial every few months.<P>
 

The IRB can stop a trial that doesn't do what it promised or one that exposes people to harm. You can complain to the IRB if you have a problem while in a trial. The people running the trial will tell you how to contact the IRB. You can also complain to the people in charge of the trial, to the Patient Representative at the trial site, or to an organization that advocates for people with AIDS.<P>


<H4>The Protocol Chair</H4>

The protocol chair is a doctor who helps plan the trial, and who is in charge of all the sites. If you don't qualify for a trial or if you're asked to leave because of one bad blood test, you can ask the protocol chair for an exception.<P>


<H3><A NAME="Leaving">Leaving the Trial</A></H3>

<H4>What happens when the trial ends?</H4>

When a trial ends, you will have an "exit interview." If you didn't know which drug you were taking, you will be told during this interview. If the trial ends early because the drug didn't work or was too dangerous, you should be told this. You may be able to continue to get the drug after the trial ends, but there is no guarantee of this. Sometimes, only enough of the drug is made for the trial, and the drug company decides not to make more.<P>


<H4>Will I get medical care once the trial is over?</H4> 

Make sure you know how to get medical care at all times, including after you leave the trial. The trial site may agree to provide you with medical care once the trial is over, but you should discuss this with the study coordinator beforehand. Continuing medical care may not be possible.<P>


<H4>Can I get the drug once the trial is over?</H4> 

Trials sometimes promise people drugs when the trial ends, but in the past, people haven't always been able to get them.<P>
 

<H4>How do I leave the trial?</H4>

You can choose to leave the trial at any time, and this should not affect the quality of care you get at the hospital or clinic in the future. If you get sick because of the drug and are asked to leave the trial, the people running the trial should make sure your medical needs are taken care of, but they might not pay for it.<P>


<H3><A NAME="Other">Other Ways to Get Treatments</A></H3>

<H4>Expanded Access Drugs</H4>

Some drugs are available before the FDA has approved them for prescription. This is called Expanded Access. The drugs 3TC, d4T and ddI have all been available through this type of program. Expanded Access drugs are almost always available for free, but you may have to pay for required lab tests and physical exams. Your doctor is required to complete forms about your response to the drug, including lab tests and possible side effects.<P>
 

Expanded Access drugs are only open to people who for some reason can't join a clinical trial. It is important to remember that drugs on programs such as these have not been shown to be safe and effective. There is reason to hope, however, that further study will show that they are. The reason they are being made available this way is to give people with fewer treatment options - those for whom AZT, ddI and ddC are no longer effective - the opportunity to try something new that might work for them.<P>
 

It is possible that a clinical trial of a new drug may provide a similar option, so if you are able to participate in a clinical trial give us a call to discuss what clinical trials or Expanded Access program you are eligible for. The Network has a complete list of the drugs that are available from drug companies and through programs for people who cannot be part of a drug trial. Call (800) 734-7104 for information on these drugs and treatment programs.<P>


<H4>Treatment IND or Compassionate Use</H4>

In the past, experimental drugs have been made available to people who had no other options for treatment through compassionate use protocols. Compassionate use protocols required that you be very sick and have no other treatment options. Compassionate use is now usually referred to as a Treatment IND protocol.<P>
 

<H4>What is an IND?</H4>

To test a drug on human beings, a drug company must request permission to do so from the federal government. Approval to start testing a drug is called an Investigational New Drug (IND).<P>
 

<H3><A NAME="Questions">What Questions Should I Ask?</A></H3>

Answers to the questions beginning on the next page will help you make an informed decision about whether or not you want to be part of a particular trial. You have the right to have all your questions answered. Some should be answered in the Informed Consent Form which the study coordinator will go over with you. Go over your questions with your doctor before meeting with the study coordinator. Feel free to ask any other questions about anything that concerns you.<P>


Don't feel you are asking too many questions or taking up too much time. While taking part in the trial may prove to be of benefit to you, that is yet to be proven. Clinical trials need human participants like you to find out if the treatment works. You are a volunteer who deserves consideration of your concerns.<P>
 

It is a good idea to write down the answers to the questions so that you can go over them and think about them later. You may want to have a friend with you who can remind you of questions or write down the answers for you.<P>


Some questions can't always be answered, such as the long term side effects of a new drug. Trials are conducted to find out the answers to questions such as these. The trial coordinator will tell you what might happen, but may also have to say they just don't know yet. You will have to decide if you are willing to take the risks that a trial involves.<P>


As long as an experimental treatment is still in any phase of trial, no one can be sure how well it will work, or even if it will work at all. The more you are informed about available treatments, the better able you will be to make a decision. Talk to other people who are in a clinical trial, or call a community organization that works with people with AIDS and HIV.<P>

<DT>Dose comparison: 
<DD>A trial that uses different amounts of the same drug. Sometimes the drug is tested against a placebo.

<DT>Dose escalation: 
<DD>In this type of trial a few people take a small amount of the drug. If it doesn't hurt 
them, a few more take a larger amount. This continues until the researchers find the largest amount of the drug that can be taken without immediate harm. 

<DT>Double-blind: 
<DD>A type of drug trial in which people are divided into different groups. One group takes the experimental drug and other groups take different doses, the standard therapy, or a placebo. Neither the researchers nor the people in the trial know who is taking what until the trial is over.

<DT>Expanded Access: 
<DD>Programs designed to make experimental drugs available on a wide basis to people who do not qualify for the drug trials or who live too far from a trial site. 

<DT>IND: 
<DD>Investigational New Drug. This is the name given to an experimental drug after the FDA agrees that it can be tested in human people.

<DT>Informed Consent: 
<DD>The name given to the process during which a person weighs the known and possible risks and benefits of a trial, then agrees voluntarily to participate. When someone agrees to be in a trial, they sign an agreement called an Informed Consent Form.

<DT>IRB: 
<DD>Institutional Review Board. Every institution or hospital that conducts research involving human subjects must have an IRB that approves and periodically reviews the research. The IRB protect the rights of the people in the trial, determines who can participate in the trial, and whether the trial is ethical. 

<DT>Open-label trial: 
<DD>A type of drug trial in which researchers and participants know who is taking the experimental drug or the treatment being given.

<DT>Placebo: 
<DD>A substance that has no effect on the body that is given to one group in a placebo-con-trolled trial. Often referred to as a sugar pill.

<DT>Protocol:
<DD>A detailed plan stating a drug trial's purpose, drug dosages, length of treatment, how the drug is given, and inclusion/exclusion criteria.

<DT>Randomized trial: 
<DD>A trial in which people are assigned to one of two or more treatments by chance. Usually a computer is used to be sure that everyone has the same chance of getting on any given part of the trial.

<h2 align=center>Trials for pregnant women</h2>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>Contact numbers on these pages are for the New York area. Many of the trials are nationwide. For sites in your area, call the AIDS Clinical Trials Information Services (ACTIS) at 1-800-TRIALS-A.</h5>

<HR size=3 align=center noshade width=50%>

<font size=2><p>ACTG 185. Drug: <B>HIVIG, IVIG, AZT for pregnant women</B>. This trial will compare HIVIG to IVIG for the prevention of HIV transmission from mother to fetus. The mothers will be divided into two groups. One group will be given IVIG. The second group will be given HIVIG. Both drugs are shots. All participants will also take AZT pills. During labor the AZT will be injected into a vein. Infants will be given the same treatment as the mothers. All infants will take AZT syrup as soon as they can take fluids for a total of 6 weeks. The study lasts for a total of 24 months following birth. This study will not be unblinded with the birth of the child. A recent study suggests that AZT may help prevent transmission of HIV infection from women with 200 or more T4 cells to their newborns. You must be 13 years or older with a T4 cell count of under 500 and pregnant for 20-30 weeks. AZT is required during pregnancy. Contact: sites in Albany, New York, Stony Brook, Syracuse, Farmington, Baltimore, Newark and Philadelphia. Call The Network at (800) 734-7104 or ACTIS at 1-800-TRIALS-A for referral.</P>

<p><img align=left hspace=5 src="../gifs/newrain.gif">ACTG 249. Drug: <b>ddI</b>. This trial will study ddI for the treatment of HIV infection in women in their third trimester of pregnancy. The first dose will be given through an IV. After the first dose and until labor, the ddI will be taken as pills. During labour it will again be given through an IV. ddI will be taken by pill again for six weeks after the baby has been born. This study is not being done to see if ddI prevents transmission of HIV from mother to baby. The study is being done to see if it is safe to give ddI during the third trimester of pregnancy. To participate, you must be HIV+, 13 years or older,  pregnant for 26-36 weeks, and with a <b>T4 cell count of between 50 and 350</b>. You must be unable to take AZT. You may not have a history of stillbirth or complicated pregnancy or be pregnant with twins. Time on study is 3 to 4 months. Contact: Mykyelle Crawford, RN, Columbia Presbytarian, New York, NY,  (212) 305-6356; Laurie Andrews, RN, Yale Univ. Medical College, New Haven, CT, (203) 785-3557; Mary Ellen Labrie, RN, Children's Hospital, Newark, NJ, (201) 268-8298.</P>

<P>ACTG 250. Drug: <B>nevirapine, AZT</B>. This trial will study nevirapine for the 
treatment of HIV in pregnant women and newborns. Participants must already be taking AZT. Nevirapine is given to the mothers while they're in labor, and the newborns are given treatment during the first week of life. Treatment during labor may reduce the level of exposure to HIV and decrease the newborn's risk of infection. Both the participants and the doctors will know which treatment is being given. You must be 13 years or older, already taking AZT and pregnant for more than 34 weeks. Contact: Eileen Chusid, PhD, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY, (212) 241-0433. </P></font></blockquote>

<h3><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h3>

<p>Previous research has demonstrated that people with HIV and AIDS are usually compelled to seek aid from entitlement programs, even if they initially have private health coverage. The important role of prescription drug therapies and nutritional interventions in the healthcare of this population is also recognized.</p>

<p>Recent cost containment and reduction efforts by federal, state and local governments have emphasized the need to quantify and evaluate the merits and deficiencies of programs that assist people with HIV and AIDS in paying for needed prescription drug treatments and nutritional interventions.</p>

<p>The AIDS Treatment Data Network collected information on AIDS drug assistance programs, Medicaid programs and pharmaceutical industry patient assistance and expanded access/compassionate use programs throughout the U.S. and its Territories. The objective of this project was to investigate access to prescription drug treatments and nutritional interventions for HIV/AIDS through these mechanisms.</p>

<p>Contact information for the relevant programs was obtained from The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the AIDS Treatment Data Network’s own pharmaceutical industry database.</p>

<p>Rather than rely on the traditional survey instrument, telephone calls were placed to all programs. Questions were posed regarding eligibility, treatments available, any restrictions and relevant policies. All fifty states, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands were contacted.</p>

<p>We discovered great variation in access to prescription drug treatments and nutritional interventions through these programs based upon geographic location. We also found that pharmaceutical industry sponsored initiatives were playing an important role in providing treatments in areas where they were not available through federal or locally sponsored programs.</p>

<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>It has been well documented that people with HIV are usually compelled to seek aid from entitlement programs, even if they initially have private health coverage. Medicaid has been reported to cover 40-45 percent of all HIV positive patients, and pay 25 percent of the U.S.A.'s total bill for AIDS-related medical care. These figures date back to 1990 and 1992 respectively. It seems likely that entitlement programs are covering an even higher proportion of the nation's AIDS care bill in 1995.</p>

<p>The role that prescription drug treatments play in the healthcare of people with AIDS and HIV has also been documented. For example, early intervention with drug prophylaxis effectively prevents Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Such early interventions can dramatically reduce hospitalization, both improving the quality of life of those with AIDS and HIV and reducing healthcare costs. It has been estimated that for every 100,000 people treated, appropriate prophylaxis with the drugs trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or dapsone - with crossover to aerosolized pentamidine if oral therapy is not tolerated - may save between $89 million to $124 million per year.</p>

<p>Recent studies have also assessed the importance of maintaining optimal nutritional status in HIV disease. Nutritional supplements, both oral and intravenous, can help maintain nutritional status.</p>

<p>In light of these facts, access to treatments through these programs is of crucial importance to people living with HIV/AIDS.</p>

<h3><a name="adaps">AIDS Drug Assistance Programs</a></h3>

<p>The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act was enacted by Congress in 1990. The CARE Act is designed to provide emergency assistance to cities hardest hit by the HIV epidemic, early intervention services to those lacking health coverage and funding for community based initiatives.</p>

<p>Title I of the CARE Act provides monies to the neediest cities; Title II monies are allocated to states and territories. The proportion of monies distributed is based on AIDS surveillance data. Ryan White funds are administered at the national level by the Human Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).</p>

<p>Title II of the CARE Act has become the main funding source for the majority of AIDS drug assistance programs, which were originally mandated by the Federal Government in the late 1980's. Exceptions currently include Pennsylvania and North Carolina where the AIDS drug assistance programs are solely state funded, and Guam, where Title II funds are used to pay for laboratory tests for indigent people with HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p>$28.3 million of Title II funds were allocated to these programs in fiscal year 1991. As of February 1993 these programs provided HIV/AIDS related medications to over 40,000 uninsured people throughout the U.S. and its Territories. </p> 

<p>Formularies (which drugs, and in some instances, nutritional supplements, are covered) and eligibility requirements for these programs are determined at the local level. As will be elucidated in our findings, this has led to substantial differences between programs. This in turn greatly affects the treatment options available to a program participant, dependent on their geographic location.</p>

<h3><a name="medicaid">Medicaid</a></h3>

<p>Medicaid is the joint state/territory and federally sponsored program that pays for healthcare for the indigent. Overseen at the Federal Level by The Healthcare Financing Administration (HCFA), Medicaid programs are granted great autonomy in deciding eligibility criteria and policy.</p>

<p>Prescription drug coverage is currently offered by all state Medicaid programs. Depending upon the program, a variety of restrictions on prescription drug benefits can affect access to drug treatment. Restrictions can include monthly prescription limits , co-payments and prior authorization requirements.</p>

<p>Programs are also allowed freedom in choosing whether to cover prescription vitamins and minerals, except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations. Oral nutritional supplements are generally classed as over-the-counter drugs by Medicaid. Each program has the prerogative to decide which, if any, over-the-counter drugs it will cover.</p>

<h3><a name="mmc">Medicaid Managed Care</a></h3>

<p>The advent of the managed care model for Medicaid will also impact upon access to prescription drug treatment. Medicaid usually reimburses health care providers on a fee-for-service basis. In the managed care model, capitated financing provides fixed compensation per patient. The General Accounting office has commented that, "(T)he incentives of a capitated payment system may encourage the inappropriate reduction of necessary services." </p>

<p>As of April 1995, 44 states contract with managed care organizations, including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's), to provide some, if not all, services to Medicaid recipients. A number of states have obtained the necessary waivers from HCFA to enroll all Medicaid recipients into managed care. These are Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and Vermont.</p>

<p>Nine other such waiver applications are pending with HCFA. These are from Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York and Oklahoma. HCFA is also reviewing concept papers from Kansas, Texas, Utah and Washington. Arizona and Rhode Island have already filed to extend their current waivers.</p>

<p>Whether enrollment is mandatory or voluntary, managed care contractors can erect their own set of hurdles to accessing a prescription drug treatment. They may have formularies that are independent of the state Medicaid program. Prior authorization procedures may also differ, as may policies on "off-label" drug use. Nutritional supplements may be excluded entirely. How some Medicaid programs have begun to address these issues will be outlined in the data summary below.</p>

<h3><a name="pharm">Pharmaceutical</a> industry patient assistance and expanded access programs</h3>

<p>Pharmaceutical industry sponsored patient assistance programs provide HIV and AIDS related medications to the indigent. Eligibility criteria vary, but usually all other sources of reimbursement must have been exhausted.</p>

<p>Expanded access and compassionate use protocols make investigational new drug treatments available to those without other treatment options. An investigational new drug (IND) is one that hasn't yet been approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). An IND treatment has only been approved for research in humans.</p>

<p>The expanded access mechanism was established in 1989 by the FDA as a way of making promising IND treatments available to those with life-threatening conditions and no other treatment options. The establishment of this mechanism was primarily a response to the demands of activist groups led by the AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power (ACT-UP). The antiretroviral drug didanosine was the first IND made available through an expanded access program on October 12, 1989. These programs act as a large, open label clinical trial in which any physician can enroll an eligible patient.</p>

<p>Pharmaceutical industry sponsored compassionate use programs also provide IND's to treat conditions for which there are no other options. Sometimes these drugs will have been approved to treat one condition, while remaining investigational in their treatment of a number of others.</p>

<p>Both expanded access and compassionate use programs are usually accessible nationwide. Eligibility criteria involve confirmation of the persons medical status to assess both need and whether the treatment is medically appropriate.</p>

<h3><a name="summary">The Access Project: Data Summary</a></h3>

<p><b><a name="adap">1. </a>AIDS Drug Assistance Programs</b></p>

<p>AIDS drug assistance programs operate in all fifty states, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Guam now uses Ryan White Title II funds to pay for the laboratory tests required by eligible people with HIV/AIDS, rather than to cover specific drugs.</p>

<p><b><a name="elig">Eligibility</a> requirements</b></p>

<p>Eligibility requirements vary widely from program to program. They are usually based upon the current Federal Poverty Level. </p> 

<p>Programs in Alaska, Maine, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and central and northeast Iowa make a case by case assessment of need with no specific earnings or asset limitations. In Montana a person must certify that the cost of the drug is an economic burden.</p>

<p>Utah requires a person to be earning less than $6,000 p.a. for full coverage. Arkansas, Florida, and Utah all require net incomes below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level (currently an income of $7,470 or less for one person). These are the most stringent income requirements of all programs. However, it is likely that the lack of asset restrictions makes these programs useful to those whose assets would disqualify them from Medicaid eligibility. At the opposite end of the spectrum New York State requires an income of less than $44,000 for an individual although, as in some other states, Ryan White Title I and II monies are commingled to assist in opening up enrollment to this degree.</p>

<p>The majority of other programs set their income thresholds around 200-400% of the Federal Poverty Level. Sliding scale co-payments for those marginally above eligibility levels are an option in Alabama, California, Delaware, Florida (although Florida stated they usually waive such co-payments), New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah and Vermont. Arkansas, Kansas and New Hampshire expressly state that they will take into account medical expenses when assessing net income.</p>

<p>Three programs list asset limitations. Nevada requires less than $4,000, Hawaii less than $10,000 and New York less than $25,000. All of these requirements are exclusive of a person’s home and car.</p>

<p>Medical eligibility is also assessed by AIDS drug assistance programs. The most basic requirement is HIV seropositive status. Many programs also use the CD4 cell count to determine eligibility.</p>

<p>Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma, Oregon and Tennessee all specify a CD4 count of less than 500 for entry into their programs, although Arizona stated this requirement was not strictly enforced. Indiana requires a CD4 count of less than 550. South Carolina refers prescriptions for those with over 500 CD4 cells to a medical advisor for adjudication. Nevada specifies less than 500 CD4's or an AIDS indicator disease as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p><font size=-1><i>For a state by state breakdown of eligibility criteria, see table 1.</i></font></p>

<p><b><a name="drug">Drug</a> coverage</b></p>

<p>Drug formularies are also subject to enormous variation. The states with the largest populations living with HIV/AIDS tend to be most comprehensive, in accordance with their receiving the largest proportion of Ryan White monies. States containing cities that receive Title I funding sometimes enhance their formularies by commingling Title I and II funds, New York being the prime example, with its coverage of 182 drug treatments.</p>

<p>Comprehensive AIDS drug formularies are provided in California, Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota and Washington. These states cover 45, 58, 131, 31, and 54 treatments respectively, including in some cases various immunizations.</p>

<p>Louisiana is unique in dividing its formulary into three levels, dependent on the where the client is receiving treatment. Level 1 includes 24 Drugs that are available anywhere in the state. Level 2 carries an extra 39 drugs in addition to 9 for children that are available in certain hospitals and ambulatory care programs. Level 3 covers an additional 80 drugs and some vitamins and nutritional supplements which are available at two main hospitals in New Orleans and Shreveport.</p>

<p>Nebraska has 21 treatments listed plus antidepressants, and state they will try and obtain any treatment a physician recommends.</p>

<p>Alaska, Delaware, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, and Wyoming all offer any FDA approved drug through their programs. Vermont offers most FDA approved therapies but specifically excludes ganciclovir due to cost considerations. Ganciclovir is an approved therapy for CMV retinitis, a common opportunistic infection that can lead to blindness. Wyoming has a theoretical spending limit of $2,000 per client, but with creative use of the industry sponsored patient assistance programs mentioned earlier, has not had to deny anyone treatment thus far.</p>

<p>A number of programs offer very few treatments. Georgia, Oregon and Utah cover only the antiretrovirals zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI) zalcitabine (ddC) and stavudine (d4T).</p>

<p>Data clearly demonstrates that the drug treatments that have had the most significant impact on survival for people with HIV/AIDS are those that prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). These preventive medications are aerosolized pentamidine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim/Septra) and dapsone. Tennesssee covers just four drugs, but while only covering three of the approved antiretrovirals (zidovudine, didanosine and zalcitabine), also has aerosolized pentamidine on the formulary. Montana covers the four approved antiretrovirals and also covers pentamidine.</p>

<P>In total, 50 of the 53 programs cover some form of PCP prophylaxis.</p>

<p>There is also recent encouraging data on the survival benefit produced by the use of the new macrolide antibiotics, clarithromycin and azithromycin, in treating Mycobacterium avium complex, a common opportunistic infection. At the time of writing 35 out of 53 programs cover one of these drugs.</p>

<p><font size=-1><i>For a compete listing of treatments available through each program, see table 2.</i></font></p>

<p><b><a name="med">Medical</a> criteria and prior authorization</b></p>

<p>12 states also have specific medical criteria for the prescription of drugs. California's criteria are based primarily on current medical usage rather than the FDA labelling. For example, it allows azithromycin to be used in the treatment of cryptosporidium diarrhea, a current investigational use that is not on the current FDA approved labelling. Florida uses the "least restrictive medical citations" when evaluating prescriptions. Iowa also considers any prescription, including off-label, as long as it doesn't exhaust too great a proportion of the entire budget. This hasn't happened yet. Mississippi restricts aerosolized pentamidine in line with it's labelling but places no restrictions on combination antiretrovirals.</p>

<p>Idaho, Indiana, Nevada, Utah and Virginia all have basic CD4 cell count guidelines for the treatments they offer. These adhere to the FDA labelling. Indiana also requires prior authorization before prescribing amphotericin B, azithromycin, clarithromycin, flucytosine, or rifabutin.</p>

<p>Hawaii and North Carolina specifically request that all drugs be used for FDA approved indications. Texas has specific guidelines for drug usage that mirror the FDA labelling.</p>

<P>Up until recently Kentucky required a doctor's statement for 7 out of the 16 drugs that it covers, but this policy was eliminated on May 1, 1995.</p>

<p>Massachusetts specifically prohibits the use of some drugs for the prophylaxis of infections. Acyclovir is not covered for prophylaxis of herpes simplex or zoster. Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, clindamycin, and leucovorin are covered for the treatment but not prophylaxis of toxoplasmosis. Fluconazole and ketaconazole are not covered for the prophylaxis of fungal infections.</p>

<p>In Michigan, the drug fluconazole is only reimbursable when treating fungal infections if ketoconazole fails or if the infection is cryptococcal meningitis. Also this program allows off-label use of the drug atovaquone for prevention of Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia if the three approved drugs (TMP/SMX, dapsone and pentamidine) are contraindicated.</p>

<p>New York limits one drug, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) to those under 18 years of age only, in line with it’s labelling.</p>

<p><b><a name="nutrit">Nutrition</a></b></p>

<p>Eleven programs offer nutritional supplements:</p>

<P>The District of Columbia can provide Advera, Ensure, Sustacal, Lipisorb and Opti. These were added to the formulary as of September 9, 1994.</p>

<P>Hawaii’s Nutritional Alliance Program offers Ensure Plus, Nutren, Advera and Peptamen to ADAP enrollees.</p>

<p>Louisiana covers ferrous gluconate or ferrous sulfate, multiple vitamins and minerals, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), Ensure and Opti. The prescription of Ensure and Opti must be approved by a nutritionist.</p>

<p>Commencing July 1, 1995 Minnesota will offer Advera, Ensure, folinic acid and multiple vitamins and minerals.</p>

<p>Mississippi covers Peptamen. A documented loss of more than 10% of body weight is required for prescription.</p>

<p>Nebraska states that a nutritionist consults at their main clinic, and that most supplements are available if deemed appropriate.</p>

<p>Nevada covers Ensure, Lactaid, Lipisorb, Benefit Liquid, Benefit Nutrition Bars, Regain Nutrition Bars and Restore Plus Liquid. These supplements are requested by physician prescription.</p>

<p>New York covers Ensure, Sustacal, Advera, Regain, pediatric nutritional formulations, multiple vitamins and minerals, beta carotene, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 (sublingual), vitamin B12 (intramuscular), vitamin C, folate, folinic acid, iron, lactaid, magnesium glutamate, selenium and zinc. The New York ADAP also covers nutritional counseling.</p>

<P>Puerto Rico has Ensure, Sustacal, Advera and Pediasure available through its care consortia. Other supplements may be covered in some circumstances.</p>

<p>The Virgin Islands has Ensure and Advera available. There are also nutrition counseling services provided at the St. Thomas Hospital HIV/AIDS Clinic.</p>

<p>Wyoming will cover any supplement that a physician prescribes.</p>

<p><b><a name="mp">2</a>. Medicaid Programs</b></p>

<P>Medicaid programs operate in all fifty states, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands.</p>

<p><b><a name="mpel">Eligibility</a></b></p>

<p>The federal government mandates that all Medicaid programs provide coverage for the categorically needy. This usually includes people receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for the aged and disabled, pregnant women and children with family incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (states have leeway to increase this ceiling to 185%).</p>

<p>Each Medicaid program can limit the number of SSI recipients who are categorically eligible for Medicaid by applying more restrictive eligibility standards than those of the SSI program. However, programs cannot impose standards more restrictive than SSI's predecessor programs in 1972. Also, since SSI payments are not available in Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, those who qualify for AFDC, as well as those that receive aid to the aged, blind and disabled, are eligible for Medicaid coverage.</p>

<p>Programs may also choose to provide coverage for the medically needy. The medically needy are defined as aged, blind or disabled individuals, or members of families with dependent children, who have too much income and/or resources to be categorically eligible but not enough for their medical care. Medical bills can be taken into account in order to "spend-down" to the categorical eligibility requirements.</p>

<p>Other optional categorical groups a Medicaid program can choose to cover are: aged and disabled persons with incomes less than 100% of the federal poverty level, institutionalized persons with incomes no greater than 300% of the SSI federal benefit rate, and the so-called Ribicoff group of children. Ribicoff children are those born after 9/30/83 who are over 6 years of age and who live in families with annual incomes up to 100% of Federal Poverty Level. The importance of this last group is that it can provide coverage to children in low income two parent families - AFDC only covers two parent families if one parent is incapacitated, or had significant work experience but is now unemployed.</p>

<p>Prior studies have concluded that the primary means of eligibility to Medicaid for people with AIDS is through SSI, due to disability. With the Center for Disease Control and Prevention having expanded the diagnosis of AIDS in 1993 this almost certainly remains the case today. Although states have some flexibility in determining income levels, they must cover the great majority of those receiving SSI.</p>

<p>The provision of Medicaid coverage to the medically needy is of greater concern. This eligibility category has been shown to be of enormous importance to people with AIDS. As HIV disease progresses, people depend on greater numbers of prescription medications, and thus also suffer an increasing financial burden. In states without medically needy programs, people are subjected to the so-called Medicaid "notch," whereby $1 of income above the AFDC or SSI cash assistance levels can mean the complete loss of Medicaid coverage.</p>

<P>The following states currently have no medically needy provisions: Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. Indiana does not offer prescription drug benefits to those that qualify through medically needy eligibility.</p>

<p><b><a name="prescrip">Prescription</a> drug coverage</b></p>

<p><b><a name="prior">Prior </a>authorization</b></p>

<p>Prescription drug coverage, although offered by every program, can come with a variety of caveats. The issue of formularies - restricted lists of medications that a program will cover - has been the subject of much debate and Congressional see-sawing. In 1981 legislation was passed that allowed such formularies to be established. By 1990, dissatisfaction with this system prompted the initiation of the Medicaid rebate program under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90).</p>

<p>Under this legislation, pharmaceutical companies entered into rebate agreements with the Health Care Financing Administration(HCFA). This guaranteed unrestricted access to their FDA approved products for all Medicaid recipients for at least six months. After this six month period, however, Medicaid programs could require physicians to obtain prior authorization before prescribing a treatment. At least one report asserts that these prior authorization systems can become defacto restrictive formularies. In another about-face in 1993, Congress once again allowed Medicaid programs to impose restrictive formularies under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.</p>

<p>Our research found that the majority of programs adhere to the manufacturer rebate agreements when establishing formularies. According to the Office of Medicaid Policy at HCFA, no states have yet utilized the 1993 legislation to impose more restrictive formularies. However, prior authorization requirements are widely used to control the prescription of certain drugs once the mandated six month period after approval has passed.</p>

<p>In Kentucky, 44 drugs commonly used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and related conditions are subject to strict prior authorization requirements. Many other programs have also utilized their ability to impose prior authorization requirements. Colorado, Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Washington and Wisconsin all have at least one HIV or AIDS-related medication that requires prior authorization. The most common treatment requiring prior authorization is erythropoeitin, listed in 11 of these states. Erythropoeitin is an expensive treatment for anemia.</p>

<p>California has requested a 10% supplemental rebate from pharmaceutical manufacturers to maintain their products on the Medi-Cal (California's Medicaid Program) formulary. This has led to products from Sandoz and Smithkline Beecham being restricted to prior authorization, although in a letter to beneficiaries Medi-Cal states that these requirements will not apply to AIDS or cancer treatments from these manufacturers. California has 12 HIV and AIDS-related drugs that require prior authorization, and another 11 that require such authorization if the patient has tuberculosis.</p>

<p>In a unique example of the use of Ryan White monies to defray Medicaid costs, Texas requires that any Medicaid recipient requiring the antiretroviral drugs didanosine, stavudine, zalcitabine, or zidovudine, and/or the Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia treatment pentamidine, obtain them through the state AIDS drug assistance program.</p>

<p><font size=-1><i>For a listing of Medicaid programs with drugs requiring prior authorization see table 3.</i></font></p>

<p><b><a name="limits">Prescription</a> limits</b></p>

<p>Federal regulations allow Medicaid programs to "place appropriate limits on a service" based on "medical necessity or on utilization control procedures." Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming all impose utilization thresholds based on number of prescriptions per month, or, in the case of New York, per year.</p>

<P>Most of these programs allow exceptions in the case of life-threatening illness. Arkansas will increase the limit from 3 prescriptions per month to 6 if it is medically necessary. New York can approve greater than 43 prescriptions per year after consultation with the recipient's doctor. However, North Dakota and South Carolina did not specify any exceptions to their limits, which are 5 and 3 prescriptions per month, respectively (South Carolina does not include injection medications when counting prescriptions). Mississippi and Texas have limits of 5 and 3 prescriptions per month, respectively, the only exception being for those under 21 years of age.</p>

<p><font size=-1><i>For a listing of Medicaid program prescription limits, see table 4.</i></font></p>

<p><b><a name="co">Co</a>-payments</b></p>

<p>The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 allows Medicaid programs to charge recipients nominal co-payments for most covered services, including prescription drugs. The federal government mandates that some categories of recipient be excepted, including those under 18 years of age, pregnant women, specified residents of medical institutions and patients needing emergency services. Federal mandate also proscribes the charging of co-payments for family planning services and any service provided by a health maintenance organization (HMO). The same section of the federal regulations prohibits any Medicaid provider from denying services due to an "inability to pay" a co-payment.</p>

<p>28 Medicaid programs currently impose co-payments for prescription drugs. These range from $0.50 to $5.00. In California the co-payment is voluntary, although this policy may soon be changed to make it mandatory. Maine will waive co-payments in cases of poverty but asserts in their Medicaid brochure, "you may be expected to pay later when you have the money”. Exactly how this policy may be enforced is not elucidated.</p>

<p>Hawaii exempts specific recipients from having to make prescription drug co-payments. These are children under 19, pregnant women, foster children under 21, those with income less than 133% of the federal poverty level, and those receiving welfare payments.</p>

<p><font size=-1><i>For a listing of Medicaid program co-payment requirements, see table 5.</i></font></p>

<p><b><a name="off">Off</a>-label use of prescription drugs</b></p>

<p>As touched upon earlier, prior to marketing a drug must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as safe and effective. The uses the drug will be approved for are determined by the information in the new drug application filed by the manufacturer. If the data are only from clinical trials of one condition, as they usually are, the drug will be indicated to treat that condition. Other potential uses may be identified by clinicians and be reported upon in the medical literature.</p>

<p>The manufacturer can file a supplemental application for new indications that are identified, but this can take time. It can sometimes become virtually standard medical practice to prescribe a drug to treat a condition for which it may not yet be approved In one study of oncologists, one third of drug prescriptions were for off-label uses. A recent study of off-label drug use in HIV disease found 40 percent of prescriptions were for off-label uses, and eight out of ten patients had received at least one off-label prescription.</p>

<p>The U.S. Code specifies that Medicaid programs participating in the manufacturers rebate agreement must cover drugs used for their medically-accepted indication. Medically accepted is defined as any use of an approved drug “which appears in peer-reviewed medical literature or which is accepted by one or more of the following compendia: the American Hospital Formulary Service-Drug Information, the American Medical Association Drug Evaluations, and the United States Pharmacopeia-Drug Information”. This means that programs utilizing the manufacturers rebate agreement are compelled by federal law to cover off-label uses that are documented in the aforementioned literature.</p>

<p>Programs in Alaska, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Vermont and West Virginia originally informed us that they would not permit such off-label coverage. This agreed with the findings of previous researchers. However, when questioned upon the relevant provisions of the U.S. Code all programs subsequently acknowledged that all prescriptions that fell within the “medically accepted’ definition would be covered.</p>

<P>Prior authorization is specifically requested for off-label uses in Colorado, Guam, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota and North Dakota. California states that its pharmacists review off-label uses closely, while Guam only verifies that the drug manufacturer has a rebate agreement with HCFA. Georgia will review a recipients prescriptions against the medical literature if they receive more than five in a month.</p>

<p><b><a name="ind">Investigational</a> New Drugs</b></p>

<p>Investigational new drugs that are made available through expanded access, compassionate use, or clinical trial protocols are usually free of charge. Manufacturers are allowed to recoup expenses under FDA regulations, and recently the expanded access program for human growth hormone, a treatment for wasting, has utilized this proviso.</p>

<p>Most Medicaid programs will not pay for an investigational drug in these circumstances. Exceptions are Illinois, who state in their administrative code: “The Department shall provide that the following types of drugs are available without prior approval: a) drugs for the treatment of AIDS which the FDA has indicated is subject to a treatment investigational new drug application”. Coverage is possible in Michigan with prior authorization.</p>

<p>Serono, the company that makes human growth hormone, reports that several other states are in fact paying for the treatment. Medi-Cal has agreed to cover it for all recipients eligible for the expanded access program. Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Rhode Island and South Carolina are considering reimbursement on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>There can also be expenses associated with administering an IND available through one of the above listed programs. These may include the equipment necessary to administer an intravenous drug, or frequent laboratory testing required by the IND protocol. Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming all indicated that such expenses could be covered. Utah excludes expenses for home administration. Minnesota and Washington require that other medically necessary services also be provided in order to cover the cost of the IND administration.</p>

<p>South Dakota will not usually cover such expenses but will make exceptions for those with HIV and AIDS on a case-by-case basis. Florida also uses case-by-case review, and also acknowledges that Medicaid recipients enrolled in managed care may face differing policies dependent on their plan.</p>

<a name="mpnu"><p><b>Nutrition</b></p></a>

<p>Under Title 42 of the United States Code, Medicaid programs are given the option to exclude coverage of prescription vitamins and mineral products, except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations. Programs may also exclude drugs available without prescription, which includes over-the-counter vitamin preparations and oral nutritional supplements.</p>

<p>Program policies relating to nutrition and vitamins vary widely. All programs can cover intravenous feeding when a person has no other source of nutrition. Prior authorization is always required. This is coverage is clearly mandatory in order to adhere to several court rulings that have held that programs must provide all “medically necessary” services to Medicaid recipients.</p>

<p>Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wyoming will consider covering oral nutritional supplements if a prior authorization request is made. Of these, Idaho specifically requests that a nutrition plan be submitted, Massachusetts requires documentation of significant weight loss and Michigan simply states that the physician explain the need for the requested supplement. South Carolina needs a statement to the effect that the patient will require hospitalization without the “commercially available nutritional supplement”.</p>

<p>The District of Columbia and Illinois will cover Advera with a prescription. Nebraska lists Ensure and Advera as covered. Wisconsin has some oral supplements available with a prescription but does not list particular brands.</p>

<p>California, Indiana, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania offer nutritional supplements specifically for those enrolled in their home care programs.</p>

<p>Certain vitamins and minerals can be covered with a prescription in Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Montana and New York. Prior authorization is required for vitamin prescriptions in Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.</p>

<p>Some programs have other approaches to covering vitamins, minerals and nutritional supplements. Ohio has Ensure and multiple vitamins and minerals available, assessments of need are made by community-based case managers who apply for coverage at the local level. Puerto Rico refers people to the Ryan White funded care consortia (see nutrition section in AIDS drug assistance programs, above).</p>

<p>Wyoming displays flexibility on issues of coverage by stating in their provider manual that “additional over-the-counter drugs may be covered, if they are medically necessary, and their use will reduce the cost of therapy when compared to a prescription drug therapy. A physician, or a pharmacist on behalf of a physician may request coverage of such products. If is determined that the coverage of such products may benefit several recipients, the products may be added to the OTC formulary, and you would be notified of such an addition.”</p>

<p><b><a name="mmc2">Medicaid</a> managed care</b></p>

<p>As outlined in the introduction to this report, many Medicaid programs are enrolling some, if not all recipients into managed care plans. These plans can have their own policies in regard to the issues covered in the previous sections. In fact, Medicaid law specifically excepts services delivered by managed care organizations from the policy controls outlined above regarding prior authorization and off-label drug use.</p>

<p>Some Medicaid programs limit the effect that the policy of an individual managed care plan can have on a Medicaid enrollee. New York State requires that any contracting managed care organization make arrangements to cover any prescription drug on the state Medicaid formulary, even if it is absent from the formulary of the individual plan.</p>

<p>Florida similarly includes the following proviso in regard to managed care contractor: “regular Medicaid policy requirements generally apply to services provided under prepaid Medicaid contracts. While expanded services may be offered, services provided by a contractor may not be more restrictive than those provided under regular Medicaid”.</p>

<p>The state pharmacist in Tennessee has insisted that people with HIV, AIDS or hemophilia be guaranteed access to any prescription drug their physician prescribes, whether or not it appears on the formulary of a contracting managed care plan. Tennessee commenced enrollment of all Medicaid participants into managed care on January 1st 1994 under a waiver obtained from HCFA. Despite the efforts of the state pharmacist a recent survey of primary care physicians uncovered great dissatisfaction with the prior authorization procedures required for some prescription drugs.</p>

<P>Arizona admits that policies relating to prescription drug coverage can vary from plan to plan. Arizona had no Medicaid program prior to 1982, when it received a waiver to institute the first statewide Medicaid managed care system based on prepaid, capitated arrangements with health plans. 23 Health plans contract with Arizona Medicaid, now known as the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS). 15 provide acute care and 8 specifically contract to provide long term care to the elderly and physically or developmentally disabled. Each of these plans has their own policies relating to prescription drug coverage.</p>

<p>Arizona does offer what is known as “reinsurance” to plans when a participants health care costs exceed a certain dollar threshold, but only in certain circumstances. Reinsurance can cover 75-85 percent of the cost of some services, reducing the financial risk incurred by the managed care plans receiving capitated payments per patient. However, outpatient services for people with AIDS are specifically excluded from reinsurance.</p>

<p>Our initial inquiries into individual managed care plans that contract with Medicaid programs suggest that policies relating to prescription drugs for HIV and AIDS may be yet more restrictive than those uncovered in section 2 above. NevadaCare, a managed care organization that contracts with Nevada Medicaid to provide services to recipients, states the following on page VI of it’s prescription drug formulary: “Certain medications are eligible for coverage only after a patient-specific approval has been authorized...Accutane, AZT/AIDS related drugs, Chemotherapeutics, Retin A, Ritalin, Sandimmune”.</p>

<p>Oxford Health Plans (NY), Inc., who contract with New York Medicaid, also state in their prescription drug rider that the some drugs will be covered only with advance written approval from Oxford’s Medical Director. The list includes “Retrovir, zidovudine, azidothymidine, pentamidine, videx, DDI, DDC, or hivid”.</p>

<p>Further research into the impact of such policies is certainly warranted. The Access Project intends to collect information on prescription drug policies from all managed care organizations that contract with Medicaid.</p>

<p><b><a name="pharm2">Pharmaceutical</a> industry sponsored programs</b></p>

<p>As of June 1995, there are 32 industry sponsored patient assistance programs covering a range of HIV and AIDS related medications.</p>

<p>Eligibility requirements are generally reported to be fairly flexible by program administrators. Detailed information on the financial eligibility is often not shared with consumers in order to preserve these programs as an avenue of last resort for someone attempting to obtain a medication. Two administrators gave figures of income less than $25,000 for one person and $40,000 for two, and felt that these were the “industry standard.”</p>

<p>Of note is the fact that the majority of these programs stated they would consider applications from those unable to obtain a treatment because of its absence from an insurers’ formulary.</p>

<p>Hard figures for the number of people enrolled in patient assistance programs are not easy to come by. However, several AIDS drug assistance program administrators stated they use them to circumvent gaps in their formularies and obtain prescription drug treatments for their clients. The Network has also made many successful referrals to these programs. This seems to indicate they can play an important role in accessing needed treatments.</p>

<p>There are also 20 open expanded access and compassionate use protocols that can provide investigational new drug treatments to those without other treatment options. Recent programs for two new anti-HIV drugs, d4T and 3TC, have enrolled approximately 27,000 and 40,000 people respectively.</p>

<h3><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>

<p>There are clearly wide gaps in the extent of coverage provided by AIDS drug assistance programs across the U.S.A. It now seems likely that the Ryan White Act, which funds the majority of these programs, will be reauthorized by Congress. However, no attempt is yet being made to standardize the services offered by the programs to all participants in the U.S.A. Perhaps facilitating the flow of information between program administrators can assist in this process in the absence of legislative guidance.</p>

<p>A problem that is certain to be faced by ADAP’s in the near future is the approval of several new anti-HIV treatments, including 3TC and a new class of drugs called protease inhibitors. It is unclear where funding will come from to support the addition of such new and potentially expensive treatments to ADAP formularies.</p>

<p>Similar issues may also arise for Medicaid. The advent of managed care will certainly place more control over access to prescription drug therapies in the hands of administrators rather than physicians.</p>

<p>It may become incumbent upon the pharmaceutical industry programs discussed above to provide a safety net for those unable to obtain a needed therapy through their local assistance program or Medicaid provider. There will, however, obviously be a limit to how much of this potential burden industry can viably bear.</p>

<p>Our findings also highlight the lack of coverage for nutritional interventions in many areas. In light of the data outlined in the introduction to this report, and particularly recent reports of significant survival benefits associated with certain micronutrients, this issue clearly needs to be addressed. Further research into the kind of nutritional services available through Ryan White funded care consortia is certainly warranted.</p>

<p>The overriding impression gleaned from The Access Project is that creative use of the programs covered in our research is allowing many low income people with HIV and AIDS to access needed drug treatments. There is, however, not a universal awareness the range of programs through which treatments are potentially accessible, and this is inevitably leads to unnecessary hardship for those paying out-of-pocket for such treatments. The Network hopes to begin to address this issue by launching the Access Project as a national information resource. We also encourage people with HIV and AIDS and their care providers to contribute first-hand experience of working with these assistance programs, to both enhance the accuracy of our information and infuse it with insight from the real world.</p>

<font size=-1><p>The AIDS Treatment Data Network (The Network) is a registered not-for-profit organization. We help men, women and children with AIDS and HIV to obtain medical care, approved and experimental treatments, social support services, and public and industry sponsored treatment programs.</p>

<p>The Access Project is a program of The Network made possible by an educational grant from Pfizer, Inc. The information presented in this report is maintained in a constantly updated database. This information is available to anyone who may need it, free of charge, in a variety of formats. We hope that The Access Project will be a useful resource for those living with AIDS and HIV, along with their caregivers and service providers.</p>

<p>The Network would like to thank all of the people at the various programs that generously gave their time to answer our questions and mail and fax relevant information to us. Without their assistance this project would not have been possible. Many people went to extraordinary lengths to help us navigate through a sometimes mystifying array of departments and contacts in search of answers to our questions. We were left with the impression that there are many people throughout the U.S. doing incredible work assisting people in getting the treatment they need. We salute them.</p>

<p>The Network would also like to the many researchers who have published work on this subject. Michael T. Isbell’s “Health Care Reform: Lessons From the HIV Epidemic” was invaluable in helping providing a framework for our research and leading us to relevant studies. Thank you also to Robert J. Buchanan from the University of Illinois was kind enough to forward two of his excellent papers on Medicaid policy, and to Peter Wansor at the New York Academy for diligently uncovering requested manuscripts and forwarding copies to us.</p></font>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/acyc.html">acyclovir</a> (Zovirax)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Acyclovir is used to treat shingles as well as herpes simplex virus and other types of herpesvirus infections which can cause painful blisters and lesions. Acyclovir reduces the severity of outbreaks and prevents the development of new blisters. Acyclovir cannot treat CMV disease, which is also caused by a herpesvirus. Acyclovir can prevent herpes simplex outbreaks, which may help people co-infected with HIV and herpes simplex live longer. High dose acyclovir is used to treat hairy leukoplakia , a viral infection that usually shows up on the sides of the tongue. Glaxo-Wellcome, Inc. makes Zovirax and has an <a href="../pa/acyc.html">HIV Patient Assistance Program</a> that can be reached at (800) 722-9294.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Acyclovir has a good toxicity profile, meaning that long term use does not produce major side effects. Stomach upset, headache or nausea are possible. Hair loss from prolonged use has been reported.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Acyclovir is available in ointment, pill, liquid, and intravenous (injection) forms. Ointment is applied every 3 hours, 6 times per day for 7 days. Pills come in doses of 800 mg and 200 mg. Severe acute episodes that do not respond to oral medications can be treated with IV acyclovir. Resistant strains can be treated with foscarnet (Foscavir). For shingles, the 800 mg tablet is used unless IV treatment is needed. You cannot take ddC with acyclovir until you are stable on acyclovir. Dosage reduction is required if you have kidney failure. If you are pregnant or breast feeding, it is recommended that you do not take acyclovir.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Herpes sores usually disappear in a few days after starting treatment. Effectiveness is noted by crusting over and healing of sores. Long-term therapy with acyclovir may be required if you have chronic outbreaks of herpes.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Medications to help reduce symptoms of nausea include Compazine, Phenergan, and Reglan. Nutrition strategies such as eating dry salted crackers and not lying down after you eat can help reduce stomach upset. Aspirin or pain killers may help with headache. Dosage may be adjusted if side effects are severe.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: alpha interferon</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>alpha-interferon (INF-alpha, <a href="../pa/alph-i.html">Intron A</a>, <a href="../pa/alph-r.html">Roferon</a>)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Alpha interferon is approved for treatment of <a href="../../simple/ks.html">Kaposi’s sarcoma</a> (KS) if you have a T4 cell count over 200. To be effective against KS, alpha interferon has to be given intramuscularly in high doses. Alpha-interferon works best if you have a T4 cell count over 400, no prior opportunistic infections, and you do not have symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Low dose alpha interferon is being tried in combination with AZT. Alpha interferon may be effective in eliminating or controlling chronic hepatitis B infection. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., who makes Roferon, has a <a href="../pa/alph-r.html">Cost Assistance Program</a> (800.227.7448), an Indigent Patient Program (800.526.6367), and Reimbursement Assistance  (800.443.6676). Schering-Plough Corp., who makes Intron, has an <a href="../pa/alph-i.html">Interactive Reimbursement Information Service</a> (800.521.7157).</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>The side effects of alpha-interferon can include flu-like symptoms, anorexia, fatigue, low-grade fever, and weight loss. Nausea is common. Side effects get worse with higher doses.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Alpha-interferon is given by injection under the skin. Typical long-term doses are from 5-15 million units daily. For controlling chronic hepatitis B infection, injections of 3 to 5 million units are given three times per week.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Resolution of symptoms indicates that treatment is effective.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Side effects diminish over time and it’s important to hang in through the initial fatigue and flu-like symptoms and remember it will get better. Visible improvement of KS takes many weeks and improvement can continue over many months. Motrin can help with side effects. Take lots of fluids during initial treatment to reduce nausea and dehydration.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: amikacin</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>amikacin (Amikin)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Amikacin is used in combination with other drugs to treat <a href="../../simple/mac.html">mycobacterium avium complex</a> (MAC). There is no single drug treatment for MAC, but multidrug therapy reduces mycobacterial colony counts in blood. Mycobacterial colony counts are a measure of the degree of infection. Symptoms improve with treatment, especially reduction of fever. Some doctors use the same multidrug therapy for maintenance as well as for treatment of acute MAC. Recent Public Health Service recommendations suggest either <a href="clar.html">clarithromycin</a> or <a href="azit.html">azithromycin</a> as the first line treatment for MAC, along with at least one other drug, usually <a href="etha.html">ethambutol</a> and one of the following: <a href="clof.html">clofazimine</a>, <a href="cipr.html">ciprofloxacin</a>, or <a href="rifa.html">rifabutin</a>.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Amikacin can cause kidney problems. Dose limiting toxicity usually occurs after a month. A new less toxic form is being studied. Safety of this drug if you are pregnant or breast feeding has not been established. A side effect of amikacin can be hearing loss.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Amikacin is given intravenously at 15/mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8-12 hours. This means that 15 mg of the drug is given for each kilogram of your weight, the dosage is divided in half and each half dose is given every 8-12 hours. The infusion takes 30-60 minutes.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Variations in response seem to depend on the state of your general health and your immune system, the strain of MAC you are infected with, and your system’s ability to tolerate a combination of medications. Resolution of signs and symptoms of infection can sometimes be seen in 3-5 days.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Early warning signs of kidney problems are decreased urination, increased thirst, or light-headedness after you stand up. Kidney problems can generally be treated. One of the purposes of frequent and repeated blood tests when you are severely ill is to make sure that your kidneys are working well. If blood tests show signs of any potential problems, treatment can begin promptly. Treatment often requires adjusting doses of certain medications, reducing your fluid intake, and following a special diet for kidney failure.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: amphotericin B</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>amphotericin B (Fungizone)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Amphotericin B is used to treat many <a href="../../simple/fungal.html">fungal infections</a> including histoplasmosis and Cryptococcus. Histoplasmosis spreads through the blood stream and may affect multiple organs and produce a wide variety of symptoms. The most common symptoms are fever, swollen glands, weight loss, respiratory problems, weakness, lethargy, and enlargement of the liver and spleen. Cryptococcus usually infects the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. If you are starting amphotericin B and are taking <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a>, you should discontinue ddC until you are stable on amphotericin B. You should not take other drugs that can affect the kidneys, such as foscarnet, at the same time as amphotericin B. A less toxic form of amphotericin B, called <a href="../../trials/fungal.html#ablc">lipid amphotericin B</a>, is being studied.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Amphotericin B can cause fevers, chills, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, kidney damage, and suppression of bone marrow which can lead to anemia. </p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Amphotericin B comes in topical and infusion form. The ointment is applied 2-4 times daily. Infusion is first given in a test dose of 1-5 mg, then treatment dose over 1 to 2 hours. You can get as much as 1 mg/kg/day or 1.5 mg/kg every other day. Amphotericin B infused rapidly is safe and better tolerated than the old long infusions. The old slow increase in dose is not always used. You may be given a test dose and then a full treatment dose. Long term maintenance therapy for histoplasmosis is 50-80 mg IV. <a href="itra.html">Itraconazole</a> can also be used for maintenance treatment for histoplasmosis. <a href="fluc.html">Fluconazole</a>, which has fewer side effects, is superior to amphotericin B for maintenance treatment for cryptococcus. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Long term maintenance of weekly or biweekly intravenous treatment is necessary. To treat Cryptococcal meningitis, the drug must be taken for 6-8 weeks or longer, depending on your response. To avoid relapse, you must have a catheter implanted in your chest for long term maintenance. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Flu-like side effects can be reduced by taking ibuprofen (Advil), acetominophen (Tylenol), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), or hydrocortisone one half hour before infusion of amphotericin B. Some doctors will give you meperidine (Demerol) both before treatment and during treatment in the same IV bag with amphotericin B. Sometimes the drug is combined at lower doses with <a href="flucy.html">flucytosine</a> if you can’t tolerate the side effects at full dose. </p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/atov.html">atovaquone</a> (Mepron)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Atovaquone is approved for the treatment of mild to moderate PCP pneumonia in people who are intolerant to standard treatments. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, commonly referred to as PCP, can affect the lungs as well as other parts of the body, including the skin and internal organs. People who are at the greatest risk of contracting this type of pneumonia are those who have less than 200 T4 cells. Symptoms of PCP include shortness of breath, dry cough, and fever. PCP seems to occur very frequently in women as a first or second AIDS-defining illness. Diagnosis in women is often delayed and the illness may be severe by the time it is detected. Atovaquone is being <a href="../../trials/pcprev.html#227b">studied</a> for prevention of PCP, and treatment of toxoplasmosis. Because it is not always well absorbed, a new suspension formulation has now been approved.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Atovaquone is well tolerated and appears to be less toxic for treatment of PCP than standard therapies such as <a href="tmp.html">TMP/SMX</a>, given orally or intravenously, and intravenous doses of <a href="pent.html">pentamidine</a>. The most common side effects are headache, nausea, diarrhea, rash and fever.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p> Adults take 750 mg 3 times per day with meals to improve absorption.  With the new suspension formulation it may not be necessary to take with food.
</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Treatment is for 3 weeks or until resolution of symptoms.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Eating dry salty foods and not lying down right after you eat can help reduce nausea. Tylenol can help with fever.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: azithromycin</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/azit.html">azithromycin</a> (Zithromax)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Azithromycin is an antibiotic used in combination with other drugs as preventive treatment against both toxoplasmosis and <a href="../../simple/mac.html">MAC</a>. Azithromycin is also used for treating <a href="../../simple/crypto.html">cryptosporidiosis</a>. The drug is available on a <a href="../pa/azit.html">compassionate use</a> basis to people who have failed or are intolerant to <a href="pyri.html">pyrimethamine</a>, <a href="sulf.html">sulfadiazine</a>, or <a href="clin.html">clindamycin</a>. Call Pfizer/Roerig at (800) 742-3029. There is no standard treatment for MAC. Recent Public Health Service recommendations suggest either <a href="clar.html">clarithromycin</a> or azithromycin as the first line treatment for MAC,  along with at least one other drug, usually ethambutol and one of the following: <a href="clof.html">clofazimine</a>, <a href="cipr.html">ciprofloxacin</a>, or <a href="rifa.html">rifabutin</a>. Azithromycin is also used to treat chlamydia.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Azithromycin can cause mild gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, as well as dizziness and sensitivity to sunlight. A possible side effect of azithromycin can be hearing loss. Azithromycin appears to have no side effects involving the liver or other major organs.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>To treat toxoplasmosis, azithromycin is used in combination with pyrimethamine at an initial dose of 1000 mg followed by 500 mg per day. Azithromycin used alone has been associated with early relapse. To treat MAC, azithromycin has been studied at 500 mg per day with promising results in individuals taking it for 30 days. Some individuals may develop azithromycin-resistant strains of MAC. To treat chlamydia, azithromycin is given in a single 1000 mg oral dose.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Maintenance treatment for MAC is necessary. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. Azithromycin has good bioavailability, so a single dose can be effective against some infections.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Medications that can help reduce the symptoms of nausea include Compazine, Phenergan, and Reglan. Nutrition strategies such as eating dry salted crackers and not lying down right after you eat can help with stomach upset and nausea. Aspirin or pain killers may help with headache. </p>

<title>ADAP drugs: bleomycin</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>bleomycin (Blenoxane)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic drug used in combination with two others to treat <a href="../../simple/ks.html">Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)</a> when it does not respond to standard treatment. KS has become the fourth most common AIDS-defining illness. Advances have been made in the treatment of KS, but no optimal therapy or adequate long-term management options have been defined. There is no curative therapy for KS. The two other drugs used with bleomycin are <a href="doxo.html">adriamycin</a> (Doxorubicin) and <a href="vinc.html">vincristine</a>, and the combination is referred to as ABV. ABV can produce rapid improvement.
</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>The major toxicity of ABV is myelosuppression, which is the suppression of bone marrow activity and can cause anemia. Bleomycin may cause fever and chills 2-6 hours after infusion which can last for 4-6 hours. The drug can also cause hair loss.
</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>An initial test dose is given of 2 units or less for the first 2 doses. Infusions of 0.25-0.5 units/kg are given weekly or twice weekly initially, or 25 units/kg/day for 4-5 days as continuous IV infusion. If favorable response occurs, a maintenance dose of 1 unit/day or 5 units/week is given. 
</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>You may have to take this drug for 2-3 weeks.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Your diet may need to be modified according to how well your system tolerates the drug. Antiemetics such as Compazine, Phenergan and Reglan may be administered prior to therapy. You should not smoke because it increases the risk of pulmonary toxicity. If the inside of your mouth becomes tender and sensitive, use a sponge brush and rinse with warm salt water after eating and drinking.

<title>ADAP drugs: capreomycin</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>capreomycin (Capastat)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Capreomycin is used to treat <a href="../../simple/mac.html">MAC</a> and tuberculosis (TB). A number of different drugs are being tried for prevention and maintenance treatment of MAC. MAC is related to TB, but no one drug works against MAC. Maintenance therapy after an episode of MAC is now routine, though it is not known which of the existing treatments is most effective. Multidrug therapy reduces mycobacterial colony counts in blood, a measurement of infection, and leads to clinical improvement, especially the reduction of fever. Capreomycin should be used with extreme caution in people with kidney impairment or hearing loss.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Capreomycin can cause anorexia, thirst, polyuria (excess urination), hematuria (red blood cells in the urine), anemia, hearing loss.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Dosage has to be determined by a doctor for each person individually.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Maintenance treatment for MAC infection is necessary. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. Treatment for TB can last six months to two years.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Be sure to drink a lot of high calorie fluids such as juices and nectars to prevent dehydration. Side effects may have to be treated with additional drugs.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: cidofovir</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/cido.html">cidofovir</a> (Vistide, HPMPC)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Cidofovir is a new treatment for CMV retinitis infection. Most adults are infected with <a href="../../simple/cmv.html">CMV</a>.  Like other infections, the virus which causes this condition takes advantage of a weakened immune system. Active CMV infection typically develops only when a person has a deficiency of cytotoxic T cells that recognize and target CMV-infected cells. CMV can infect different parts of the body, and CMV retinitis, a disease caused by this herpesvirus, can cause blindness. Giliad Sciences, which makes cidofovir, has a <a href="../pa/cido.html">Support Services Program</a> that can be reached at (800) 445-3235.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Cidofovir can be harmful to the kidneys. If someone is taking cidofovir, doctors need to watch for early signs of kidney problems using blood and urine tests. Decreased urination, increased thirst, or light-headedness after standing up can also be early warning signs of kidney problems. If a person already has kidney problems, cidofovir may not be an appropriate treatment for them.</p>

<p><a href="../../simple/cido.html#alert">An alert</a> has been issued about cidofovir causing kidney failure. It is very important to follow the medical guidelines for using cidofovir to avoid this potentially fatal side effect. For copies of the alert and guidelines for medical providers call (800) 445-3235.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Cidofovir is given by intravenous infusion, directly into a vein in the arm. The infusion is given once a week for the first two weeks - this is called the induction treatment. The infusion is then given once every other week to keep the CMV infection under control. You do not need a catheter installed to take cidofovir. A catheter is a device that's permanently placed in your chest if you need to take an intravenous drug regularly.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>CMV retinitis usually stabilizes or sometimes improves with treatment in 10-20 days. Long-term maintenance therapy is necessary. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. Retinitis will ultimately  recur in most people despite maintenance and can be re-treated with higher doses. You must get periodic eye exams.  For prevention, the <a href="../../simple/cytovene.html">pill form of ganciclovir</a> may be prescribed for people at risk for active disease. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>To try and prevent kidney damage, cidofovir is given with a lot of fluids. Probenecid, a drug that helps protect the kidneys, must also be given with cidofovir. Unfortunately, probenecid contains sulfa, a substance that can cause allergic reactions. Side effects caused by reactions to sulfa-containing drugs can include rash and fever.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: ciprofloxacin</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/cipr.html">ciprofloxacin</a> (Ciloxan, Cipro)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Ciprofloxacin is one of the drugs used in combination to treat <a href="../../simple/mac.html">MAC</a>. If you are HIV+ and travelling to a country where intestinal infection is common, discuss what drug you should take with your doctor. The risk of intestinal infections may be reduced by taking preventive drugs such as norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and <a href="tmp.html">Bactrim</a>, though in some instances these drugs might actually worsen infection by disrupting normal intestinal bacteria. Recent Public Health Service recommendations suggest either <a href="clar.html">clarithromycin</a> or <a href="azit.html">azithromycin</a> as the first line treatment for MAC,  along with at least one other drug, usually <a href="etha.html">ethambutol</a> and one of the following: <a href="clof.html">clofazimine</a>, ciprofloxacin, or <a href="rifa.html">rifabutin</a>.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are the most frequent side effects of ciprofloxacin. Bad taste in the mouth, restlessness, rash, sensitivity to sunlight and seizures are other possible side effects.
</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Cipro comes in intravenous and pill form. Pills are taken on an empty stomach 2 hours after meals, 250-750 mg every 12 hours. If there is stomach irritation, the pill can be taken with meals. Food slows and may slightly decrease absorption. If you are taking antacids, you should take them at least 2 hours before or after the cipro. Intravenous infusion is 200-400 mg every 12 hours. Infusion takes one hour. Cipro is also given in drops into the eye to treat some eye infections. You will be given 1-2 drops 4-6 times daily until the infection is controlled. Children under 18 should not take ciprofloxacin. Safety is not established if you are breast feeding. Dosage reduction is required if your kidneys are damaged. If you have any CNS infections, cipro must be used with caution.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Variations in response depend on the state of your general health and immune system, the strain of MAC you are infected with, and the ability to tolerate a combination of drugs. The decision about what drug to take must partly be based on how sick you are and whether treatment has a chance of improving your quality of life. If you have clinical symptoms but a relatively well-functioning liver and kidneys, you will respond best to treatment. Treatment usually helps within 2 to 4 weeks. If it does work, ongoing maintenance therapy to suppress the infection is necessary. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Cipro may cause dizziness or lightheadedness. If you have loose or foul-smelling stools, tell your doctor as that could be a sign of another strain of MAC or a different infection. Drink a lot of high calorie fluids such as juices and nectars to prevent dehydration.

<title>ADAP drugs: clarithromycin</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/clar.html">clarithromycin</a> (Biaxin)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p><b>NIAID alert 7/27/96</b>: clarithromycin (Biaxin) should not be used at doses over 1000 mg a day, as doses higher than that have been associated with poor survival.</p>

<p>Clarithromycin is an antibiotic approved for treatment of common bacterial infections in non-immunocompromised individuals. Clarithromycin is used orally for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract and skin and skin structure infections. Clarithromycin is approved for the treatment of <a href="../../simple/mac.html">MAC</a>. It may also be useful alone, or in combination with azithromycin, for the treatment of toxoplasmosis. Clarithromycin may be an effective prophylaxis treatment for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Recent Public Health Service recommendations suggest either clarithromycin or <a href="azit.html">azithromycin</a> as the first line treatment for MAC,  along with at least one other drug, usually <a href="etha.html">ethambutol</a> and one of the following: <a href="clof.html">clofazimine</a>, <a href="cipr.html">ciprofloxacin</a>, or <a href="rifa.html">rifabutin</a>.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Clarithromycin is generally well tolerated. Infrequent side effects are diarrhea, nausea, and abnormal taste. Clarithromycin may cause severe abdominal pain at high doses. There has recently been two reports of people experiencing mania as a side effect of clarithromycin. The mania went away when the drug was stopped.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Clarithromycin comes in 250 mg and 500 mg tablets. Dosage has to be determined by a doctor for each person.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Continual use on a regular schedule for 4-6 days to treat infection is usually necessary. For streptococcal throat infections, treatment is at least 10 days. Multiple-drug treatment of MAC with clarithromycin at 500 mg to 2 g daily, ethambutol, and/or ciprofolxacin, clofazimine, amikacin or rifabutin is for at least 6 weeks. Ongoing maintenance therapy as prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis and MAC is required. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>If diarrhea develops and continues for more than 24 hours, let your doctor know promptly.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: clindamycin</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>clindamycin (Cleocin)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Clindamycin is an antiparasitic drug used in combination with <a href="pyri.html">pyrimethamine</a> for maintenance treatment of toxoplasmosis. Clindamycin is used to treat acute toxoplasmosis, although it may not be as effective as pyrimethamine-sulfa.  Clindamycin is also used as an experimental treatment for active PCP pneumonia. Clindamycin is used for treatment of skin infections, respiratory tract infections, septicemia, abdominal infections, gynecologic infections, and topical treatment of severe acne.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Clindamycin may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and mild rash. IV administration can cause a bitter taste in the mouth.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Clindamycin comes in oral, injection  and ointment formulations. The drug does not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier, but it crosses the placenta and enters breast milk. Clindamycin is mostly processed in the liver, so it should not be prescribed if you have liver impairment. Safety of the drug in pregnant or breast feeding women is not established. By mouth, adults are prescribed 150-450 mg every 6 hours. Pills must be taken with meals. Oral solution should not be refrigerated and is stable for 14 days at room temperature. Shake liquid preparations well. You must finish the drug as directed, even if you are feeling better. IV clindamycin is given 300-600 mg every 6-8 hours. Greater than 600 mg is not recommended. Topical clindamycin is applied in a 1% solution twice daily. The solution is flammable, so do not apply while smoking or near heat or flame. Wait 30 minutes after washing or shaving before applying.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Improvement should be seen in 2-3 weeks, but may take 8-12 weeks for maximum benefit. If you have toxoplasmosis, long term suppressive therapy is necessary. Improvement when used as treatment for PCP should be seen in 10 days.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Notify your doctor immediately if diarrhea, abdominal cramping, fever, or bloody stools occur, and do not treat with antidiarrheals without your doctor’s approval.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: clofazimine</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>clofazimine (Lamprene)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p><b>Note</b>: a recent study has called into question the role of clofazimine in treating MAC. See <a href="../../news.html#clof">In The News</a>.<p>

<p>A number of different drugs are being tried for prevention and maintenance treatment of <a href="../../simple/mac.html">MAC</a>. MAC is related to tuberculosis (TB), but no one TB drug works against MAC. Maintenance therapy after an episode of MAC is now routine, though it is not known which of the existing treatments is most effective. Multidrug therapy reduces mycobacterial colony counts in the blood and leads to clinical improvement, especially the reduction of fever. Clofazimine is one of the combination of drugs used to treat MAC. Recent Public Health Service recommendations suggest either <a href="clar.html">clarithromycin</a> or <a href="azit.html">azithromycin</a> as the first line treatment for MAC,  along with at least one other drug, usually <a href="etha.html">ethambutol</a> and one of the following: clofazimine, <a href="cipr.html">ciprofloxacin</a>, or <a href="rifa.html">rifabutin</a>.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Because drugs are used in combination, side effects can be due to the different drugs and how you tolerate them together, so it is difficult to predict in advance what combination of drugs will be tolerated. Side effects can be gradual skin discoloration and intestinal problems.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Clofazimine comes in 50 mg and 100 mg capsules. Capsules should be taken with food. Adults take 100 mg every 8 hours. Total daily dosage should not exceed 300 mg.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Variations in response depend on the state of your general health and immune system, the strain of MAC you are infected with, and the ability to tolerate a combination of drugs. The decision about what drug to take must partly be based on how sick you are and whether treatment has a chance of improving your quality of life. If you have clinical symptoms but a relatively well-functioning liver and kidneys, you will respond best to treatment. Treatment usually helps within 2 to 4 weeks. If it does work, ongoing suppressive maintenance treatment is necessary. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Clofazimine should be taken with food in order to minimize side effects.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Clofazimine should not be used in salvage or treatment therapy for disseminated MAC. See <a href="../../news.html#clof">In the News</a>.</p>

<h1 align=center>clotrimazole <BR>(Gyne-Lotrimin, Lotrimin, Mycelex)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Clotrimazole ointment is used to topically treat <a href="../../simple/fungal.html">vaginal candidiasis</a> and candida of the scrotum and anus. Clotrimazole is also used for candida infections like jock itch and athlete’s foot, and to treat thrush infections of the esophagus and mouth.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>No side effects with topical treatment. Occasional side effects of oral medication are nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, and change in liver function. Clotrimazole has been used in second and third trimesters of pregnancy without adverse effects.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Clotrimazole comes in lozenge, topical cream and solution formulas, as well as over-the-counter vaginal cream and tablet form. Clotrimazole is the most common topical treatment for thrush. A 1% solution is applied twice daily. Clotrimazole comes in 10 mg lozenges that are held in the mouth until they dissolve, 5 times daily. For vaginal fungal infection, 100 mg tablets daily for 7 days or 200 mg for 3 days (non-pregnant only) are prescribed. If the infection is uncomplicated, you may be treated with one 500 mg dose, or 5 g of 1% vaginal cream daily for 7-14 days. Vaginal preparations should be used at bedtime for maximum contact with mucous membranes. If you miss a dose, do not double doses.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>You should experience a decrease in skin irritation and discomfort, followed by a clearing of the infection. Length of time to improve depends on the organism and site of infection.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Change clothing in contact with the infected area after each application. Use sanitary napkins to prevent staining of clothing or bedding. Lie down for at least 30 minutes following vaginal treatment. The medication may cause minor skin irritation in your sexual partner. Either refrain from sex during treatment or have your partner use a condom.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: cyclophosphamide</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Neosar)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Cyclophosphamide is a cancer treatment, and is used to treat Hodgkin’s disease, lymphomas, leukemias, and a variety of other tumors. Unlabeled uses include treatment of severe active rheumatoid arthritis, and the drug also has immunosuppressant action in smaller doses. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Heart inflammation, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia (decreased number of blood platelets), and leukopenia (lower than normal number of white blood cells). Use of phenobarbital, <a href="rifam.html">rifampin</a>, or allopurinol at the same time may increase toxicity. Cardiotoxicity may be additive with other cardiotoxic agents such as <a href="doxo.html">doxorubicin</a>. Treatment with <a href="cyclop.html">cyclophosphamide</a> may decrease antibody response to live virus vaccines and increase the risk of adverse reactions.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Cyclophosphamide should not be used in pregnant or breast feeding women. It should be used cautiously if there are active infections, bone marrow depression, or chronic debilitating illnesses. The drug should be administered on an empty stomach, unless severe gastric irritation develops. Cyclophosphamide is given intravenously in a dilute solution of 100 mg over 1 minute.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Effectiveness of the drug is seen if there is a decrease in size or spread of malignant tumors. Maintenance therapy may be instituted if your white blood cell count remains between 2500-4000 and you don’t suffer serious side effects. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>To reduce risk of cystitis, adults should drink at least 3 quarts of fluids per day and children should drink 1-2 quarts of fluid per day. Avoid intramuscular injections and rectal temperatures. Antiemetics may be given 1/2 hour before administration of drug to minimize intestinal effects. Compazine and Dramamine are antiemetics. There are others. Your doctor will prescribe the best one for you. The drug is best tolerated when taken during or after meals.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: cycloserine</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>cycloserine (Seromycin)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Cycloserine is sometimes used in combination with up to 5 other drugs as a treatment for <a href="../../simple/mac.html">MAC</a>. Cycloserine is also used to treat tuberculosis (TB). A number of different drugs are being tried for prevention and maintenance treatment of MAC. MAC is related to TB, but no one TB drug works against MAC. Maintenance treatment after an episode of MAC is now routine, though it is not known which of the existing treatments is most effective. Multidrug therapy reduces mycobacterial colony counts in blood and leads to clinical improvement, especially the reduction of fever. 
</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Nervous system symptoms, which are usually related to higher doses of cycloserine, can be convulsions, drowsiness, headache, tremor, dizziness, confusion and disorientation, hyperirritability and aggression. Other side effects are allergy, skin rash, and elevated liver function tests. Individuals with severe kidney impairment should not be given this drug. </p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Cycloserine comes in capsules. The usual dosage for adults is 250 mg twice a day for the first three weeks. A daily dosage of 1 g should not be exceeded.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>TB treatment continues for a minimum of one year. Maintenance treatment for MAC will have to be ongoing. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Don’t drink alcohol, which may increase the risk of seizures. Many of the neurotoxic effects of cycloserine can be treated and prevented with treatment at the same time of 200 to 300 mg of pyridoxine (vitamin B6 and vitamin B12) daily. Take with food.</p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>cyproheptadine hydrochloride (Periactin)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Periactin is an antihistamine that comes in syrup and pill form. Periactin also has sedative effects and calcium-channel blocking activity. Periactin is used to treat some hormonal disorders, including inhibited orgasm that may be a side effect of taking antidepressants. Periactin has also been shown to stimulate appetite and weight gain in children and adults. Periactin is sometimes used as an adjunct therapy in children who are taking human growth hormone.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Side effects occur with all antihistamines and will vary between individuals. Mild drowsiness to deep sleep is not unusual. Dizziness, low energy, disturbed coordination, and muscular weakness may occur. Children may get over-excited and even have seizures. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation may occur. Other side effects include dryness of the mouth, nose and throat, trouble urinating, vertigo, blurred vision, tightness of the chest, wheezing, stuffed nose, sweating, chills, early period, headaches, and faintness.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Dosage must be determined individually according to each person’s response and tolerance. For the management of weight loss, adults and children 13 years and older usually start with 2 mg 4 times daily which is gradually increased over 3 weeks up to 8 mg 4 times daily.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Response to treatment depends on the condition being treated.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Avoid alcohol. If you are already taking sedatives or tranquilizers, consult with your doctor about possible drug interactions. Gastrointestinal symptoms may be decreased by taking the drug with meals or with milk. Do not take if you have asthmatic attacks. Safety during pregnancy has not been established. The drug should not be taken by mothers who are breast feeding.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: cytarabine</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>cytarabine (Ara-C, cytosine arabinoside, Cytosar-U, Tarabine PFS)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Ara-C is used in combination with other chemotherapies to treat leukemias and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, including Progessive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is caused by a virus which affects the brain and central nervous system. Ara-C is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and is injected into the spine for treatment of meningeal leukemia.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Nausea and vomiting are the most common side effects. Other side effects can be headache, hepatitis, rash, anemia, leukopenia (lower than normal number of white blood cells), thrombocytopenia (decreased number of blood platelets), and fevers. At high doses, symptoms include corneal toxicity, fluid and swelling in the lungs, and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Ara-C should not be given to pregnant or breast feeding women. Additive bone marrow depression occurs with radiation therapy. The IV induction dose for adults is 100-200 mg/m2/day or 3 mg/kg/day as a continuous infusion over 24 hours, or divided doses by rapid injection for 5-10 days. The treatment may be repeated in 2 weeks. The high dose regimen is 2-3 g/m2 over 1-3 hours every 12 hours for 2-6 days.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Treatment is continued every 2 weeks until the cancer is in complete remission, or blood cell counts fall below acceptable levels.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Drink at least 2 quarts of fluid each day. Allopurinol may be given to decrease uric acid levels. Administering an antiemetic and adjusting diet as tolerated may help maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and nutritional status. Your doctor will prescribe the best antiemetic for you. The infusion should be given slowly to help decrease side effects. Report any unusual bleeding. Use a soft toothbrush and electric razor, avoid falls, and do not drink alcoholic beverages or take drugs containing aspirin, because these substances can cause gastric bleeding. Check your mouth for redness and ulceration. If you have mouth sores, use a sponge brush and rinse with warm salt water after eating and drinking. Consult with your doctor and nutritionist if pain interferes with your ability to eat.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: dapsone</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>dapsone (DDS)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Dapsone is an effective antibiotic used for prophylaxis against PCP pneumonia. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, commonly referred to as PCP, can affect the lungs as well as other parts of the body, including the skin and internal organs. People who are at the greatest risk of contracting this type of pneumonia are those who have less than 200 T4 cells. Symptoms of PCP include shortness of breath, dry cough, and fever. PCP seems to occur very frequently in women as a first or second AIDS-defining illness. Diagnosis in women is often delayed and the illness may be severe by the time it is detected. Dapsone alone is probably less effective than <a href="tmp.html">Bactrim/Septra</a> for prophylaxis. Dapsone with trimethoprim is an effective treatment of PCP. Dapsone with <a href="pyri.html">pyrimethamine</a> is being studied for the prevention of toxoplasmosis.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Anemia, allergic reaction such as widespread rash, and fever.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Dapsone and <a href="dida.html">ddI</a> should not be taken together. The antacid used in the formulation of ddI may prevent dapsone from being absorbed. Some people do use ddI and dapsone in combination, but take them at least 2 hours apart to reduce the risk of getting PCP. Dapsone is taken in pill form. The usual dose is 25 mg four times per day. It can also be given as 50 mg twice a day, or as a single dose of 100 mg per day. In such high dose, anemia may be more frequent.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Because dapsone is a preventive treatment, you will continue treatment as tolerated to prevent you from getting active PCP or other opportunistic infections that you may be susceptible to.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>If you have an allergic reaction to dapsone, desensitization may work. This means starting with smaller doses and gradually building up to the standard dose, giving your system time to adjust to the drug.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: dexamethasone</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>dexamethasone</h1>
<h3 align=center>(Ak-Dex, Dalalone, Decadrol, Decadron, Decaject, Decameth, Dexacen, Dexasone, Dexon, Hexadrol, Mymethsone, Oradexon, Solurex)</h3>

</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Dexamethasone suppresses inflammation and normal immune response, and is used systemically and locally to treat chronic inflammatory disorders, severe allergies, and other diseases.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Chronic treatment with dexamethasone will lead to adrenal suppression. Adrenal glands produce necessary hormones and some steroids. Chronic use in children inhibits growth, and the lowest possible dose should be used over the shortest period of time. The most common side effects are depression, euphoria, hypertension, nausea, anorexia, decreased wound healing, acne, muscle wasting, bone pain, and increased susceptibility to infection. Inflammation is one of the ways your body fights off infection, and if the inflammatory response has to be suppressed, usually because it is an autoimmune response, then your immune system is not as able to fight off other infections.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Doses are mostly determined by response. Adults take by mouth 0.5-9 mg daily in single dose or 3-4 divided doses. Topical 1% cream or gel, or .01 or .04% spray is applied 3-4 times daily. Dexamethasone also comes in solutions for treating infection in the eye, and nasal sprays, and intramuscular and IV infusions. If dose is ordered daily, it should be given in the morning to coincide with the body’s normal secretion of cortisol.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>The treatment is working if the inflammatory responses and allergic reactions due to immune response are controlled. Treatment should not be stopped without medical supervision. If you’ve been taking dexamethasone for over a period of a year, you may need to take it at times of high stress such as surgery or serious illness until your adrenal glands recover their function.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>If you are taking pill form, take with meals. Stopping the drug suddenly may result in anorexia, nausea, fatigue, weakness, hypotension, difficult or painful breathing, and hyper or hypoglycemia (high and low blood sugar). If these problems appear, notify your doctor immediately. These problems can be life-threatening. Eat a diet high in protein, calcium and potassium, low in salt and moderate in carbohydrates. Monitor your blood sugar levels daily. Report to your doctor immediately if you have severe abdominal pain or black stools occur or any other side effects including behavioral changes. Dexamethasone is not compatible with daunorubicin, <a href="doxo.html">doxorubicin</a>, mataraminol or vancomycin.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: didanosine (ddI)</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/dida.html">didanosine</a> (ddI)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>ddI is a nucleoside analogue like <a href="zido.html">AZT</a> used to treat HIV infection. Because ddI has different side effects than AZT, if you are unable to tolerate AZT, you may be able to take ddI. ddI has also been shown to be work in combination with AZT. Recent studies indicate that anti-HIV drugs are far more effective when used in <a href="../../simple/combo.html">combination</a>. If someone has already taken AZT, the combination of AZT and ddI has been shown to be more effective than AZT and <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a> in delaying disease progression. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., who makes Videx, has <a href="../pa/dida.html">Reimbursement Assistance</a> and Temporary Assistance Programs. Call 800.788.0123 for more information. There is now a <a href="../../news.html#ddi">new mandarin orange flavored tablet</a> which is smaller than the older ddI tablets, and also dissolves faster in water (it takes about two minutes).</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>The most common side effects reported are stomach pain, diarrhea and symptoms of pancreatitis. Painful and persistent peripheral neuropathy at high doses, hepatitis, seizures, headaches, abnormal bone marrow function, and allergic reactions are less commonly reported side effects. Serious adverse reactions have been reported in people taking ddI at the same time as rifabutin and clofazimine to treat MAC. If you are taking intravenous <a href="pent.html">pentamidine</a> for PCP at the same time as ddI, there is an increased risk of pancreatitis.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Dosage ranges from 250 mg to 600 mg depending on body weight. Tablets are available in 25, 50 and 150 mg dosages. The amount is usually divided into 2 doses, taken morning and evening. ddI also comes in soluble powder form which can be dissolved in liquid. ddI is inactivated by gastric acid so the tablets include a buffering agent to decrease acidity. Two tablets are taken at a time to allow intake of enough buffering agent. ddI should be taken on an empty stomach because taking with food reduces its concentration in the blood. ddI should not be taken in combination with dapsone.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Maintenance treatment is necessary unless resistance or intolerance to drug occurs, at which time you may be switched to other antiretrovirals. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug or drugs to control an infection so that you don't become ill.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Avoid alcohol, which can increase risk of pancreatitis. Pancreatits can appear as a pain in the stomach area that goes through to your back. If peripheral neuropathy develops, which is not so frequent at a lower dose, you may want to stop the drug for 4 to 6 weeks and then restart at a dose 35-50% less than what you were taking. ddI is now being taken in combination with other antiretrovirals at lower doses to lessen side effects.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: doxorubicin</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>doxorubicin (Adriamycin)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Doxorubicin is used alone and in combination with other drugs for treatment of tumors including malignant lymphomas and leukemias. A new liposomal version of this drug called <a href="../../simple/doxil.html">Doxil</a> has been recently approvedl as a <a href="../../simple/ks.html">Kaposi’s sarcoma</a> treatment. Liposomal means that the drug is put inside tiny bubbles of fat. These fat bubbles should take more of the drug to where it’s needed, and reduce side effects. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Doxorubicin is given intravenously. Dose for adults is 60-75 mg/m2 once in 21 days, or 30 mg/m2 daily for 3 days every four weeks. Total cumulative dose should not exceed 550 mg/m2 without monitoring for cardiac function. </p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Doxorubicin is given intravenously. Dose for adults is 60-75 mg/m2 once in 21 days, or 30 mg/m2 daily for 3 days every four weeks. Total cumulative dose should not exceed 550 mg/m2 without monitoring for cardiac function.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>The effectiveness of treatment can be seen by decrease in size or spread of malignancies in solid tumors, or improvement of hematologic status in leukemias.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Notify your doctor promptly if you have fever, sore throat, signs of infection, bleeding gums, bruising, blood in stools or urine, and increased fatigue. Avoid crowds and persons with known infections. Use a soft toothbrush and electric razor and avoid falls. Do not drink alcoholic beverages or take drugs containing aspirin because these can cause gastric bleeding. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water after eating and drinking. Practice contraception during treatment and for at least 4 months after therapy is concluded. Notify your doctor immediately if you have irregular heart beat, shortness of breath, or swelling of legs. Tell your doctor if you get a skin irritation at the site of previous radiation therapy. Do not receive any vaccinations without discussing with your doctor.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: dronabinol</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/dron.html">dronabinol</a> (Marinol)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Dronabinol is a synthetic version of substance called THC. THC is the active ingredient in Marijuana. It produces a high or stoned feeling but also stimulates appetite and soothes nausea. Dronabinol was approved by the government in 1985 for treating the nausea produced by chemotherapy in cancer patients. In 1992 it was approved for prescription to people with AIDS to stimulate appetite and combat weight loss. The company that makes Marinol has set up an <a href="../pa/dron.html">assistance program</a> for those who have no insurance. Your healthcare provider or pharmacist can call 800.274.8651 for more information.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>The most common side effect is feeling euphoric or high. Other side effects include dizziness, drowsiness and abnormal thinking.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Dronabinol is sold in 2.5 mg, 5mg and 10mg capsules. Doses used in studies ranged from 2.5 - 20 mg a day.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>An increase in appetite 1-2 hours after taking drug would demonstrate that the treatment is working.  </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Side effects often go away after a few days of continued use. If they don’t, taking the drug one hour before lunch and one hour before dinner often helps. If side effects continue despite this dosing schedule, taking one 2.5 mg capsule before going to bed has been successful in some people.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: erythropoeitin</title>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/eryt.html">erythropoeitin</a> <br>(EPO, Epogen, Eprex, Procrit, epoetin alfa)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Erythropoetin is used to treat anemia associated with HIV infection or AZT therapy. Anemia is a condition due to a low number of red blood cells. Erythropoetin is a natural hormone secreted by the kidneys that acts on the bone marrow to stimulate production of red blood cells. Recombinant EPO is a synthetic version of this hormone. EPO is approved for treatment of anemia in both AZT-treated HIV+ people, and people with chronic kidney failure. Ortho Biotech, who makes Procrit, has a <a href="../pa/eryt.html">Patient Assistance Program</a> wich can be reached at (800) 553-3851).</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>EPO is generally well tolerated. Side effects can include chest pain, swelling due to retention of fluid, fast heart beat, headache, high blood pressure, increase in number and concentration of circulating red blood cells, seizures, shortness of breath, skin rash, pain in joints, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, or flu-like syndrome after each dose.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>EPO must be injected. Initial dosage in studies was 100 units/kg IV 3 times weekly for 8-12 weeks. If the response to treatment is not satisfactory in terms of reducing transfusion requirement after 8 weeks, the dose may be increased by 50-100 units/kg. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>In studies, many individuals who received transfusions did not require them after 2-3 months of treatment with EPO. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Preexisting high blood pressure should be controlled before beginning treatment. Flu-like symptoms usually appear within 1 1/2 to two hours after starting the infusion and can last for 2-12 hours. These side effects are generally self-limiting and don’t require dose reduction. Aspirin or Tylenol before infusion of drug and a reduction in the infusion rate can help minimize side effects.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: ethambutol</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/etha.html">ethambutol</a> (Myambutol)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Ethambutol is used in combination with other drugs for prevention and treatment of <a href="../../simple/mac.html">MAC</a> and drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). MAC is caused by a type of mycobacteria. This type of organism causes TB as well as MAC. MAC and TB usually cause severe weight loss. It also may cause fevers, night sweats and chills. Maintenance therapy after an episode of MAC is now routine, although it is not known which of the existing available treatments is the most effective. The decision about what drug to take must partly be based on how sick you are and whether treatment has a chance of improving your quality of life. Those who have clinical symptoms but a relatively well-functioning liver and kidneys will respond best to treatment.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Acute gout, chills, pain and swelling of joints, skin rash, fever, numbness, tingling, burning pain, weakness of hands or feet, blurred vision, eye pain, red-green color blindness, some loss of vision, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache and mental confusion.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Ethambutol comes in 100 mg and 400 mg tablets. Adults take 15-25 mg/kg of body weight once daily. The total daily dose should not exceed 900-2500 mg. Ethambutol may be taken with food to reduce stomach irritation. The tablet can be crushed if that makes it easier to take.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Treatment usually helps within two to four weeks. If it does work, ongoing suppressive maintenance treatment is necessary. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Drugs that can help reduce the symptoms of nausea include Compazine, Phenergan, and Reglan. Eating dry salty foods like crackers can also help with nausea and vomiting. Don’t lie down right after you eat. Report promptly to your doctor any changes in vision or unusual sensations in your hands or feet.</p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>ethionamide (Trecator SC)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Ethionamide is a treatment for <a href="../../simple/mac.html">MAC</a> and tuberculosis (TB) used in combination with as many as 5 other drugs. A number of different drugs are being tried for prevention and maintenance treatment of MAC. MAC is related to TB, but no one TB drug works against MAC. Maintenance treatment after an episode of MAC is now routine, though it is not known which of the existing treatments is most effective. Multidrug therapy reduces mycobacterial colony counts in blood and leads to clinical improvement, especially the reduction of fever. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting. Other side effects can be depression, rash, low number of blood platelets, jaundice and/or hepatitis, inflammation of the mouth, mental depression, clumsiness or unsteadiness, confusion, mood or mental changes, changes in menstrual periods, coldness, decreased sexual ability, dry puffy skin, weight gain, high blood sugar levels, blurred vision, loss of vision, and skin rash.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Ethionamide should be given with at least one other effective anti-TB drug. Adults take 0.5 to 1.0 gram/day in divided doses. Treatment with pyridoxine at the same time is recommended.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Anti-TB drugs have to be taken for at least one year. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Taking an antiemetic before treatment can help decrease or prevent gastrointestinal side effects. Antiemetics prevent or relieve symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Compazine and Dramamine are antiemetics. There are others. Your doctor will prescribe the best one for you.</p>

<h1 align=center>etoposide (VP-16, Vepesid)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Etoposide has shown effectiveness in preliminary studies for treatment of advanced skin <a href="../../simple/ks.html">Kaposi’s sarcoma</a> (KS). KS is a type of cancer which men with AIDS may develop. KS is very rare in women with AIDS. The most common symptoms of KS are purplish or brown spots or marks on the skin, often called lesions. KS may spread inside the body as well. Etoposide is a chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, inflammation of the mouth, loss of coordination of muscle movement, burning or prickling sensation on the skin, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath or wheezing, pain at site of injection, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue, and hair loss.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Etoposide is taken orally or intravenously. Dosage has to be determined by a doctor for each person individually.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Effectiveness of treatment is indicated by resolution of symptoms.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>As with other chemotherapies, taking an antiemetic before or during treatment may help with side effects. Compazine and Dramamine are antiemetics. There are others. Your doctor will prescribe the best one for you.</p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/filg.html">filgrastim</a></h1>
<h3 align=center>(Neupogen, G-CSF, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor)</h3>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Filgrastim is used for treatment of neutropenia and infection in people who are receiving bone marrow suppressing drugs for cancer treatment. Neutropenia is a condition referring to a low number of neutrophils in the blood. Neutrophils are a white blood cell important in defending the body against infections. Neutropenia can be a side effect of drugs such as <a href="zido.html">AZT</a> and cancer treatments.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Bone pain is a common side effect. Use of filgrastim should be avoided for 24 hours before and after chemotherapy.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Filgrastim is given intravenously or subcutaneously. Dosage is 5 mcg/kg/day as a single injection daily for up to 2 weeks. Dosage may be increased to 5 mcg/kg during each cycle of chemotherapy depending on severity of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Safety is not established in pregnant or breast feeding women.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Effectiveness of treatment is indicated by decreased incidence of infection.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>If you are giving G-CSF to yourself at home, do not reuse the needle, vial or syringe. You will be provided with the proper containers for disposal.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: fluconazole</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/fluc.html">fluconazole</a> (Diflucan)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Fluconazole is used for treating <a href="../../simple/fungal.html">fungal infections</a> such as Candida albicans and Cryptococcal meningitis. Candida infection can show up as thrush in the mouth, or vaginal candidiasis. Cryptococcal meningitis is inflammation of the linings of the brain or spinal cord. Most people who develop cryptococcal meningitis have T4 cell counts below 100. Another fungal infection, coccidioidomycosis, can also be treated with fluconazole. Some doctors are starting people with low T4 cell counts on fluconazole or a related drug, <a href="itra.html">itraconazole</a>, as preventive treatment for fungal infections. Pfizer Inc., who makes Diflucan, has a <a href="../pa/fluc.html">Patient Assistance Program</a> that can be reached at 800.869.9979.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Fluconazole has fewer side effects than the previous standard treatment, <a href="amph.html">amphotericin B</a> (Fungizone). Side effects can include headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. Although elevation in liver function tests is possible, this drug has far less liver toxicity than ketoconazole. Liver dysfunction can show up as unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. There have also recently been reports of reversible hair loss after long term use of fluconazole.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Fluconazole is available in pill form. Fluconazole can be safely taken with AZT. Dosage is dependent on infection and can be pill or intravenous form. Dosage for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg initially, then 100 mg once daily for at least 3 weeks or 2 weeks following symptomatic improvement. Up to 400 mg/day has been used.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Fluconazole should be used on an ongoing basis after one episode of cryptococcus. There is not much data on using fluconazole for prevention. Maintenance with fluconazole is common if there are recurrences of thrush. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. For candida infection, treatment usually lasts 3-4 weeks. For cryptococcal meningitis, treatment lasts 10-12 weeks, followed by suppressive therapy of 200 mg once daily. Full course of therapy may require weeks or months of treatment following resolution of symptoms.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>If any of symptoms of liver dysfunction occur, notify your doctor immediately.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: flucytosine</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>flucytosine (Ancobon, 5FC)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Flucytosine is used to treat serious <a href="../../simple/fungal.html">fungal infections</a> caused by Candida or Cryptococcus. Cryptococcus usually infects the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord, causing cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis is usally treated with intravenous <a href="amph.html">amphotericin B</a>. Sometimes a doctor will use a combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine to try and bring the cryptococcal infection under control more quickly. However, recent studies show that this combination may be no better than amphotericin B alone due to the side effects of flucytosine. Other new studies have shown that the combination of flucytosine  and another antifungal drug, <a href="fluc.html">fluconazole</a>, may be just as effective as intravenous amphotericin B at treating cryptococcal meningitis. Flucytosine and fluconazole are both pills.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Bone marrow toxicity can cause anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia and, rarely, agranulocytosis and eosinophilia. Other side effects can be nausea, vomiting, anorexia, bloating, diarrhea, and, rarely, bowel perforation. Reversible elevations in liver enzymes have been reported. Occasionally, rashes may be a side effect. Some side effects that have only been seen very rarely are confusion, hallucinations, headaches, sedation, vertigo and liver enlargement.There has also been a case of severe allergic-type reaction to the drug in at least one person with AIDS. This type of reaction is called anaphylaxis.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>The usual dosage of flucytosine for adults and children is 50-150mg/kg daily, administered in equally divided doses at 6 hour intervals.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Therapy may be required for several weeks to bring a serious fungal infection under control. Once the infection is brought under control maintenance therapy is usually necessary. Maintenance therapy means you continue taking a treatment so that you don’t become ill. Flucytosine is not usually used as maintenance therapy.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Nausea can be reduced by giving the dose of flucytosine over a 15 minute period. You should be closely monitored during flucytosine therapy to check for any blood, liver or kidney side effects.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/fosc.html">foscarnet</a> (Foscavir, trisodium phosphonoformate)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Foscarnet is a first line treatment for <a href="../../simple/cmv.html">CMV</a> retinitis and a treatment for CMV colitis if ganciclovir therapy is ineffective or not tolerated. Foscarnet crosses the blood brain barrier and can treat susceptible infection in the brain. Foscarnet is compatible with AZT because it doesn’t contribute to the suppression of the production of white blood cells often caused by using AZT. Strains of herpes that are resistant to treatment with acyclovir can be treated with foscarnet, and the drug recently received full approval for this indication. Foscarnet may have some anti-HIV activity. Astra Pharmaceuticals, who makes Foscavir, has an <a href="../pa/fosc.html">Assistance and Reimbursement Program</a> that can be reached at (800) 488-3247.
</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Foscarnet can cause kidney problems. Dehydration and sodium depletion may impair the passage of fluid through the kidneys causing decreased function and sometimes failure. These problems typically occur in the third week of treatment. Other drugs that affect the kidneys like <a href="amph.html">amphotericin B</a> and <a href="pent.html">pentamidine</a> should be avoided. In men, the foscarnet the body gets rid of in the urine may sometimes irritate the end of the penis, causing sores about two weeks after the beginning of treatment. If sores occur they will go away even with the continuation of foscarnet.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Foscarnet needs to be given with fluids to prevent kidney damage. Foscarnet is given intravenously over long term and requires a catheter. A catheter provides access to your bloodstream so you can give yourself the drugs you need. Foscarnet is given starting with an induction phase at high dose that is then lowered to the standard dose. During induction, foscarnet is infused three times a day. During maintenance, the drug is infused once a day. The dose must be regularly adjusted depending on its effects on the kidneys as measured by lab tests. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Maintenance treatment is necessary to prevent recurrence of CMV. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Drink lots of fluids. Your doctor will test for early signs of kidney problems with blood and urine tests. Decreased urination, increased thirst, or light-headedness after standing up are warning signs of kidney problems. Treatment is replacement of fluids and sodium. It is important to be treated promptly.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: ganciclovir</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/ganc.html">ganciclovir</a> (Cytovene, DHPG)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Ganciclovir is a treatment for <a href="../../simple/cmv.html">CMV (cytomegalovirus)</a> infection. Most adults are infected with CMV.  Like other infections, the virus which causes this condition takes advantage of a weakened immune system. Active CMV infection typically develops only when a person has a deficiency of cytotoxic T cells that recognize and target CMV-infected cells. CMV can infect different parts of the body, and CMV retinitis, a disease caused by this herpesvirus, can cause blindness. Hoffman-La Roche Laboratories, which makes Cytovene, has a <a href="../pa/ganc.html">Provisional Assistance Program</a> that can be reached at (800) 444-4200.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Ganciclovir suppresses bone-marrow production of the white blood cells called neutrophils.  This condition is called neutropenia. Some people can take <a href="zido.html">AZT</a> with ganciclovir, especially if they are taking <a href="filg.html">G-CSF</a> to treat the neutropenia associated with both drugs. You must discontinue <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a> until you are stable on ganciclovir. Ganciclovir can also harm the kidneys, reduce testosterone levels, and cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rash.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Ganciclovir is either given intravenously on a long-term basis through a catheter or in a <a href="../../simple/cytovene.html">pill form</a>. A catheter is basically a tube. One end is surgically inserted into a large vein in your chest. The other end of the catheter remains outside your chest or has an injectable port just under the skin, providing access to your bloodstream so you can give yourself the drug. An oral form of ganciclovir is also approved by the FDA for prevention and maintenance treatment of CMV. Although the pill form may be very slightly less effective than the IV drug, doctors can now prescribe it if you choose not to have a permanent catheter. The dosage of the oral drug is 3 grams per day, which is 12 pills.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>CMV retinitis usually stabilizes or sometimes improves with treatment in 10-20 days. Long-term maintenance therapy is necessary. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. Retinitis will ultimately  recur in most people despite maintenance and can be re-treated with higher doses of ganciclovir or foscarnet. You must get periodic eye exams.  For prevention, the pill form of ganciclovir may be prescribed for people at risk for active disease. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p><a href="filg.html">G-CSF</a> and <a href="sarg.html">GM-CSF</a>, synthetic versions of two of the messenger chemicals of the immune system that are used to boost production of certain white blood cells, are used to treat neutropenia caused by ganciclovir. Other side effects improve for many people over a matter of weeks as they become accustomed to the drug.</p>

<h2 align=center>ganciclovir implants (Vitrasert)</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for CMV retinitis currently enrolling, as well as for other opportunistic infections, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/ois.html">Drugs for treating opportunistic infections</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<font size=-1><P>CMV retinitis is an infection in the eye caused by the <a href="cmv.html">cytomegalovirus</a>. CMV can also infect other parts of the body. Researchers have been studying a special implant that is put directly into an infected eye. The implant slowly releases <a href="../access/drugs/ganc.html">ganciclovir</a>, a drug used to treat CMV infection. When the infection is only in the eye, the implants have shown good results. The implant, called Vitrasert, has now been approved for general use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </p>

<p><b>Trial results</b><br>
Between October 1992 and December 1993, study sites in Bethesda, Maryland and Atlanta, Georgia enrolled 26 participants with newly diagnosed CMV retinitis. Participants were divided into two groups. One group was given the implant immediately and the second group was given the implant if the retinitis got worse. Participants in the study had no progression of newly diagnosed CMV retinitis for about eight months using the ganciclovir implant. Among those who received no immediate treatment, the eye infection worsened in about 15 days. Although surgery is required to use the implant, the procedure is performed under local anesthesia, takes less than one hour, and can be done on an outpatient basis.</p>

<p>The implants are designed to release ganciclovir over a period of months. The best time for replacement of the implant is unknown. In the study, the implants released the drug at different rates, making it hard to know when the implant needed to be replaced. The current information is that implants should be replaced after 32 weeks to lessen the likelihood of a relapse.  Most participants in the study enjoyed good vision with the implant. By the final followup eye examination, 34 of 39 eyes treated with the implant had nearly perfect vision (20/25). The researchers also reported that nearly all affected eyes had blurred vision immediately after receiving the ganciclovir implant. Normal vision returned on average within 4 weeks.</p>

<p>A second, larger trial studied 148 people with newly diagnosed CMV retinitis. Participants were divided into three groups. One group was treated with standard intravenous ganciclovir. The second group was treated with an implant that released 1 mcg of ganciclovir into the eye every hour. The third group was treated with an implant that released 2 mcg of ganciclovir into the eye every hour.</p>

<p>In this study, both groups receiving the implant had no progression of their CMV for an average of over six months. People receiving standard intravenous ganciclovir experienced progression of their CMV after an average of just over three months.</p>

<p><b>Side effects</b><br>
 The surgical procedure that places the implant in the eye does have some risks. Of the 148 people in the larger study, four people experienced inner eye inflammation (called endophthalmitis) that led to blindness. There were also 17 cases of retinal detachment. However, as retinal detachment generally occurs in about 18% of people with CMV retinitis, the risk does not seem to be increased by the implant. </p>

<p><b>Some cautions</b><br>
Because the implant releases ganciclovir into the eye only, there is concern that those who receive the treatment may develop CMV infections in their unaffected eye and elsewhere in the body. In the first study, the researchers reported a high rate of infection in the second eye. Of the 21 patients who entered the study with only one eye affected, 14 developed CMV retinitis in the other eye. Doctors treated 11 of these patients with ganciclovir implants in their second eye with similar good results. In addition, eight of the 26 study participants developed CMV infections in other organs. These patients were treated with either ganciclovir or foscarnet, the approved treatments for CMV.</p>

<p>There may be ways to reduce the risk of CMV spreading to other parts of the body. A <a href="cytovene.html">pill form</a> of ganciclovir is now available by prescription. Used in combination with the implant, oral ganciclovir may help protect other parts of the body from CMV. <a href="../trials/cmvret.html">Studies</a> of ganciclovir implants in combination with oral ganciclovir are ongoing. Call The Network for a referral.

<p><i>If you are having blurred vision or other problems with your eyes, it's important to see an ophthalmologist who is experienced in examining and treating people with HIV. Don't wait. Eye problems can become permanent and even lead to blindness if not treated promptly. An ophthalmologist is a doctor who specializes in eyes.</i></p>

<p>Chiron Vision, the makers of Vitrasert, have a <a href="../access/pa/gan-i.html">patient assistance program</a> that can help people having difficulty paying for the treatment. Call (800) 843-1137 for more information.</p></font>

<title>ADAP drugs: indinavir (Crixivan)</title>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/indi.html">indinavir</a> (Crixivan)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Indinavir (trade name Crixivan, also known as MK-639) is one of a new group of anti-HIV drugs called <a href="../../simple/protease.html">protease inhibitors</a>. These drugs work by blocking a part of HIV called protease. When protease is blocked, HIV makes copies of itself that can't infect new cells. In studies, indinavir has greatly reduced the amount of HIV in the body and raised T4 cells, even when they were very low. Researchers recommend taking indinavir with at least one other nucleoside analog anti-HIV drug (<a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a>, <a href="stav.html">d4T</a> or <a href="lami.html">3TC</a>). For the strongest anti-HIV effect indinavir should be taken with two nucleoside analogs. Until early 1997, indinavir will only be available <a href="../../../pwahg/info/crix.html">via mail order</a> from Stadtlanders Pharmacy. This is due to a limited supply. The number to call for more information is (800) 927-8888.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>The most common side effects of indinavir are kidney stones and the temporary elevation of a substance in the liver called bilirubin. These have been seen in about 2-3% of people taking the drug so far. Bilirubin usually returns to normal levels on it's own.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>The recommended dosage of indinavir is 800 mg every 8 hours. The drug should be taken with water on an empty stomach, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. Alternatively, indinavir may be taken with other liquids such as skim milk, juice, coffee, or tea, or with a light meal, e.g., dry toast with jelly, juice, and coffee with skim milk and sugar; or corn flakes, skim milk and sugar. The antibiotic drug <a href="rifa.html">rifabutin</a> (Mycobutin) can be affected by indinavir. Researchers recommend that the dose of rifabutin be cut in half when taken with indinavir. The drug <a href="keto.html">ketoconazole</a> (Nizoral) can increase blood levels of indinavir. A dose reduction of indinavir to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered if you are taking ketoconazole.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

Maintenance treatment is necessary unless resistance or intolerance to drug occurs, at which time you may be switched to other anti-HIV drugs. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug or drugs to control an infection so that you don't become ill.

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>To avoid dehydration and kidney stones, it is recommended that you drink at least 1.5 liters (approximately 48 ounces) of liquids during the course of 24 hours. Check for broken pills when you open a new bottle of indinavir, as the powder inside the capsules can be foul tasting and cause nausea. To avoid developing resistance to the drug, it is very important not to skip doses. If you do miss a dose, don't double the following dose. Try and stick as close to the 8 hour schedule as possible, as this keeps a constant level of indinavir in your body, making it harder for HIV to become resistant to the effects of the drug.</p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>isoniazid (INH, Lanizid, Nydrazid)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Isoniazid is used as a first-line treatment for tuberculosis (TB) in combination with other drugs for the treatment of active disease. Isoniazid is also used for prevention of TB in people who have been exposed to active disease but have no symptoms.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Peripheral neuropathy is the most common side effect. Signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are numbness, tingling, or an unusual sensation such as burning or prickling on the skin. Hepatitis is the most dangerous. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Signs and symptoms of hepatitis are yellow eyes and skin, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dark urine, unusual tiredness, or weakness. Severe reactions may occur if you eat foods containing high concentrations of tyramine such as aged cheeses, avocados, bananas, beer, caffeinated beverages, chocolate, sausages, liver, overripe fruit, red wine, smoked or pickled fish, yeasts, and yogurt.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Isoniazid comes in tablet, syrup and injectable forms. Isoniazid must be used cautiously if you have a history of liver damage or chronic alcoholism. While safety is not established, isoniazid has been used with <a href="etha.html">ethambutol</a> to treat TB in pregnant women without harm to the fetus. Dosage is 5-10 mg/kg/day (usually 300 mg) or 15 mg/kg 2-3 times per week. Take the drug on an empty stomach, at least 1-2 hours before meals.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Resolution of symptoms indicates treatment is effective. TB drugs may have to be taken for as long as 2 years.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Isoniazid must be taken with vitamin B6 to reduce the incidence of peripheral neuropathy. Take 40-50 mg of vitamin B6 per day. If GI irritation becomes a problem, drug may be administered with food, although food decreases absorption of isoniazid. Antacids may also be taken 1 hour before administration. If you are being treated by injection, you may experience discomfort at the injection site. Massage site after administration and rotate injection sites. Notify your doctor if any signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or hepatitis occur. Changes in visual clarity, eye pain, or blurred vision should be reported. Avoid the foods listed above. These can cause redness or itching of the skin, hot feeling, rapid or pounding heartbeat, sweating, chills, cold clammy feeling, headache, or lightheadedness. Notify your doctor if any of these reactions occur.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: itraconazole</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/itra.html">itraconazole</a> (Sporonox)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Itraconazole is a maintenance treatment for <a href="../../simple/fungal.html">fungal infections</a> and is being studied for prevention of histoplasmosis, and for treatment of mild cases of histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is an infectious disease caused by a fungus, primarily involving the lungs and occasionally spreading to the skin. The fungus is of unknown natural source. Most reported cases are from the USA, chiefly in the southeastern states and the Mississippi River valley, and occur in men aged 20 to 40. When infection occurs in the lungs, a dry hacking or productive cough, chest pain, fever, chills, drenching sweats, and shortness of breath may occur. Itraconazole is available in pill form for systemic treatment of vaginal candidiasis.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Nausea, headaches, fatigue, abdominal cramps, rash, and loss of potassium.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Itraconazole comes in 100 mg capsules. Itraconazole should be taken with food. You shouldn't take antacids, anticonvulsants or <a href="rifam.html">rifampin</a> at the same time as itraconazole, because they can reduce the effectiveness of treatment. For treatment of blastomycosis or histoplasmosis, the recommended initial adult dosage is 200 mg once daily. If there is no apparent improvement, the dosage can be increased by 100 mg increments daily up to a maximum dosage of 400 mg daily. Dosages exceeding 200 mg daily should be divided into 2 doses daily. For treatment of aspergillosis, a daily dose of 200 to 400 mg is recommended. In life threatening situations it is recommended that a loading dose of 200 mg three times a day (600 mg a day) be given for the first three days.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Clearing of symptoms of fungal infection indicate the drug is working. Treatment should continue for at least 3 months until lab tests show that the fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment can result in recurrence of active infection. 
</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Drugs that can help reduce the symptoms of nausea include Compazine, Phenergan, and Reglan. Eating dry salty foods like crackers can also help with nausea and vomiting. Don’t lie down right after you eat.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: IVIG</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>IVIG (Gamma globulin, immune globulin, intravenous immunoglobulin, Gammagard)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>IVIG is a solution of globulins containing antibodies normally present in adult human blood. Globulins are simple proteins that provide immunity against disease. A protein is made up of several amino acids, which are the microscopic building blocks that make up all cells. Many globulins are inherited, so that the body is able from birth to fight off bacteria and other infections. IVIG is used for maintenance treatment of people who are unable to produce sufficient amounts of immune globulin antibodies. Children who are HIV+ have impaired primary and secondary responses to infection. IVIG can help prevent or treat infections such as meningitis, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, acute sinusitis, pneumonia, acute mastoiditis, or abscess of an internal organ. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Side effects have not been well defined in HIV+ people, but are rare in the general population. Some pain, tenderness and muscle stiffness generally occur at the injection site and last for several hours. Headache following infusion is a possible side effect.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>IVIG is injected intravenously or intramuscularly. In studies, children were given 400 mg/kg once a month as preventive treatment for serious bacterial infections. Adults with thrombocytopenia were treated with 1 g/kg on days 1 and 2 and 1 g/kg on day 15. Thrombocytopenia means a decreased number of blood platelets which are cells important for blood clotting.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Children in the study were followed for 17 months with good response. Response to treatment in adults with HIV-related thrombocytopenia was seen in 8 days. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Most adverse reactions appear to be related to the rate of administration rather than the dose and may be relieved by decreasing the rate of administration or by temporarily stopping the infusion. Oral antihistamines and analgesics may help with headaches, and have been used before beginning treatment in individuals who have headaches following infusion.</p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>kanamycin (Kantrex)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Kanamycin is an anti-infective used for treatment of infections when penicillin or other less toxic drugs can't be used. Infections treated include bone, respiratory tract, skin, soft-tissue, and abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infections, endocarditis, septicemia, and enterococcal infections. Treatment of enterococcal infections requires combination with penicillin.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Hearing changes and reactions related to the ears, toxicity to kidneys, hypersensitivity reactions.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Kanamycin is inactivated by penicillins when co-administered to people with kidney damage. Dosage is not to exceed 1.5 g/day. Blood levels should be monitored periodically during therapy. Monitor kidney functions throughout therapy.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Effectiveness is indicated by resolution of signs and symptoms, usually within 3-5 days.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Report to your doctor any signs of hypersensitivity, ringing in ears, dizziness, or hearing loss. The most frequent sign of hypersensitivity to a drug is a stable, elevated rash called maculopapular rash (a skin rash that can have bumps). The reaction typically occurs eight to fourteen days after starting the drug. Most hypersensitivity reactions to a drug stop after discontinuing treatment. If the reaction is mild, sometimes you can continue the drug.</p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/keto.html">ketoconazole</a> (Nizoral)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Ketoconazole is used to treat <a href="../../simple/fungal.html">fungal infections</a>. Off-label use is for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Ketoconazole in pill form is used for systemic treatment of thrush. Pill form is more convenient than topical ointment because you only need to take one pill a day. You must have regular blood tests because ketoconazole can damage your liver. Ketoconazole is less expensive but less effective and more toxic than <a href="fluc.html">fluconazole</a>. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Ketoconazole can suppress hormone production, including testosterone, especially at high doses over a long time. Ketoconazole must be used cautiously if you have a history of liver disease. Hepatitis is the most dangerous side effect of this drug. Antacids and other drugs that increase gastric pH may decrease absorption. Additive liver toxicity can occur if used in combination with other liver toxic agents such as alcohol. You may experience nausea and vomiting. Ketoconazole should not be taken with the antihistimine Seldane (also known as terfenadine). Together they can lead to dangerously irregular heartbeats.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Ketoconazole comes in pill, ointment and shampoo forms. Adults take 200-400 mg/day in a single dose. Children older than 2 years take 3.3-6.6 mg/kg/day in a single dose. Topical 2% cream is applied 1-2 times daily. Apply enough ointment to cover affected and surrounding areas and rub in gently. Shampoo is applied twice weekly for 4 weeks waiting at least 3 days between treatments. <a href="rifam.html">Rifampin</a> can reduce effectiveness of both drugs.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Treatment for candidiasis is 1-2 weeks, and for other systemic infections at least 6 months. Chronic candidiasis usually requires maintenance therapy. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Nausea frequently lessens as you get used to the drug. Sometimes you can switch drugs to one that causes less nausea. Drugs that can help reduce the symptoms of nausea include Compazine, Phenergan, and Reglan. Take with meals or snacks to minimize nausea and vomiting. If you have achlorhydria, a condition in which the stomach fails to produce gastric acid, you should take fluconazole. People with AIDS may be at increased risk for achlorhydria. Ketoconazole is not absorbed by  people without gastric acid or who take antacids or H2 blockers such as cimetidine. </p>

<title>ADAP drugs: lamivudine (3TC, Epivir)</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/lami.html">lamivudine</a> (Epivir, 3TC)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>3TC, trade name Epivir (also known as lamivudine), is a new anti-HIV treatment in the same class of drugs as <a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a> and <a href="stav.html">d4T</a>. These drugs are called nucleoside analogs. The body breaks down these drugs into chemicals that stop HIV from infecting uninfected cells in the body, but it does not help cells that have already been infected with the virus. Studies have shown that <a href="../../simple/combo.html">combination anti-HIV treatment</a> that includes 3TC can raise T4-cell levels, lower levels of HIV, and delay disease progression. Studies also show that 3TC treatment may make AZT work better, even in people who have already taken AZT for a long time. 3TC may also work well with d4T in people who can't take AZT. This combination is being studied. 3TC has been approved by the government for use in combination with AZT in people with less than 500 T4 cells.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>In studies, the side effects of headache, nausea and fatigue were all seen in more than a quarter of the people taking the combination of 3TC and AZT. Other side effects seen were nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea, neuropathy (burning pain in the hands or feet), neutropenia (low white blood cells) and anemia (low red blood cells). These side effects are often seen with AZT taken alone. Hair loss has been reported as a rare side effect of 3TC, mainly at higher doses than are used now. In children, 3TC can cause a side effect called pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is a dangerous swelling of an organ in the body called the pancreas. Children taking 3TC should be carefully monitored for this side effect.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>The current recommended dosage is 150 mg twice a day. 3TC comes in pill form or a liquid solution for children. 3TC can be taken with or without food.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

Maintenance treatment is necessary unless resistance or intolerance to drug occurs, at which time you may be switched to other anti-HIV drugs. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug or drugs to control an infection so that you don't become ill.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Blood tests should be done regularly to watch for signs of neutropenia and anemia. Triglycerides should be monitored to look for signs of pancreatitis, this is particularly important in children taking 3TC.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: leucovorin</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>leucovorin</h1>
<h3 align=center> (Citrovorum, Wellcovorin, folinic acid)</h3>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Leucovorin is the active form of the B complex vitamin, folate. Leucovorin is used as an antidote to drugs that decrease levels of folic acid. Folic acid helps red and white blood cell formulation and the synthesis of hemoglobin. Some treatments require what is called leucovorin rescue, because the drug used to treat the cancer or other infection has had an adverse effect on folic acid levels. Leucovorin is used to reduce anemia in people taking <a href="daps.html">dapsone</a>, a preventive treatment for PCP. Leucovorin is also taken to decrease the bone marrow toxicity of sulfa drugs, and in combination with <a href="pyri.html">pyrimethamine</a> to decrease the toxicity of toxoplasmosis treatment. Leucovorin is used in combination with trimetrexate to prevent bone marrow toxicity. Leucovorin is also used in combination with chemotherapy such as <a href="meth.html">methotrexate</a>.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Allergic sensitization reactions such as skin rash and itching have been reported in both oral and injected treatments.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Leucovorin comes in tablet and injectable forms. Adults are treated with 10 mg/m2 every 6 hours by intravenous or intramuscular injection. The same dosage applies to tablet form. Injection is preferable to oral dosage following chemotherapy if there is a possibility of vomiting and not absorbing the treatment.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Because this is a rescue treatment to counteract another drug treatment, treatment with leucovorin depends on whether that's made necessary by other drugs you are being treated with. Leucovorin should not be used to treat pernicious anemia because it does not counteract the central nervous damage that is the result of vitamin B12 deficiency. Have your doctor measure vitamin B12 levels before starting leucovorin.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Although some allergies to treatment have been reported, there are no serious side effects.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>methotrexate</h1>
<h3 align=center>(Amethopetrin, Folex, Folex PFS)</h3>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Methotrexate is used alone or in combination with chemotherapies, surgery or radiation for treatment of cancers, lymphomas, leukemias, rheumatoid arthritis, and severe psoriasis.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Treatment with methotrexate, as with other chemotherapy agents, can have many side effects such as upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, liver toxicity, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Some drugs, such as anti-inflammatory agents and <a href="acyc.html">acyclovir</a>, can increase the toxicity of methotrexate.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Dosage reduction is required if you have any kidney impairment. Treatment is by mouth, intramuscular or intravenous injection, or injection into the spine. Dosage depends on the condition being treated. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Effectiveness of treatment can be seen in improvement of blood markers in leukemia, decrease in size and spread of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas and other solid cancers, resolution of skin lesions in severe psoriasis, decreased joint pain and swelling, and improved mobility if you are being treated for rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Drink at least 2 quarts of high calorie fluids such as juices and nectars per day. If treatment is in pill form, take 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. Report any unusual bleeding to your doctor. Use a soft toothbrush and electric razor. Do not drink alcoholic beverages or take drugs containing aspirin. Avoid use of over-the-counter drugs without first consulting with your doctor or pharmacist. Contraception should be practiced during and for at least 8 weeks after completion of therapy.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: metronidazole</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>metronidazole</h1>
<h3 align=center>(Flagyl, Metryl, Protostat, Satric, Neo-Tric)</h3>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Metronidazole is an antibacterial and antiprotozoal drug.  It is commonly used to treat a condition called amebiasis. Amebiasis can cause diarrhea in people with HIV/AIDS. If the amebiasis is severe or does not respond to treatment with metronidazole alone, iodoquinol or diloxanide furoate may be added. Another intestinal condition called giardiasis is also treated with metronidazole. Other conditions that this drug may be prescribed to treat are trichomoniasis, anaerobic bacterial infections, bacterial vaginosis, Helicobacter pylori  and antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. Both pill and ointment preparations of metronidazole have been used with some success in treating the skin inflammations and eruptions caused by rosacea.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>The most frequent side effect is nausea. This is sometimes accompanied by headache, anorexia, dry mouth, and a sharp, unpleasant metallic taste. Rarer side effects can include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and constipation. The drug can affect the nervous system and cause headache, dizziness and peripheral neuropathy. Less frequently it may cause depression, irritability, restlessness, insomnia and convulsions. Urinating may become painful and urine may become dark or reddish-brown due to the way the body absorbs the drug. Rare effects on the blood are leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. In cases of hypersensitivity, allergic-type skin reactions and nasal congestion may occur.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>For acute intestinal amebiasis the standard dose is 750 mg three times a day. In children this is reduced to 35-50 mg per kg of body weight in three divided doses daily. For giardiasis the usual dosage is 250 mg three times daily.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Your doctor will monitor your stools for the presence of the parasites that cause amebiasis and giardiasis. Treatment is usually for 5-10 days in cases of amebiasis, 5-7 days for giardiasis.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Take with meals to avoid stomach upset. Avoid alcohol as vomiting will result due to the drug. Other medications can be affected by metronidazole. Levels of anticoagulants, lithium and phenytoin may be dangerously increased. Disulfiram and metronidazole should not be used together due to the possibility of acute psychoses and confusion - manufacturers recommend a two week break between these treatments. Barbituates may increase levels of metronidazole in the body, increasing the risk of side effects. Cimetidine (Tagamet) may decrease the amount of metronidazole in the body and lessen its effects.</p>

<h1 align=center>nystatin</h1>
<h3 align=center>(Mycostatin, Mykinac, Nilstat, Nystex, O-V Statin)</h3>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Nystatin is a common topical treatment for <a href="../../simple/fungal.html">thrush</a>. Thrush can show up in the mouth, on the tongue or the gums. Thrush can also appear on the skin. It is difficult to determine whether thrush has spread throughout the body, but white patches or red blotches in the mouth are common signs, as well as a change in the taste of food. Thrush can cause a sore throat, pain when swallowing, and even nausea. Oral nystatin is also used for treatment of intestinal candidiasis or to prepare the bowel for GI surgery.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Nystatin can temporarily affect the sense of taste and thus decrease appetite. Some products may contain propylene glycol, alcohol, parabens, or benzyl alcohol. Avoid use if you are sensitive to these additives. Other side effects can be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Use regularly several times a day. The drug will be effective only if you follow directions carefully. Nystatin comes in tablets or a liquid suspension that is meant to be swished for several minutes around in the mouth and then swallowed. For vaginal infections, insert one vaginal tablet daily and lie down for at least 30 minutes following administration. Vaginal treatment should be continued during menstruation. Avoid use of tampons during therapy. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Symptomatic relief usually occurs within 24-72 hours after starting therapy. Therapy for a period of 2 weeks is usually sufficient but more prolonged therapy may be necessary. Therapy should be continued for 48 hours after symptoms have disappeared to prevent relapse.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>During treatment for vaginal candidiasis, use sanitary napkins to prevent staining of clothing or bedding. Refrain from sexual contact during therapy or have partner wear a condom to prevent reinfection. When taking oral doses, it is best taken on an empty stomach to avoid nausea, vomiting, and GI distress.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>octreotide acetate (Sandostatin)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Sandostatin has similar effects to a natural hormone called somatostatin and is given by injection. Sandostatin suppresses growth hormone. It is used to treat flushing and diarrhea associated with certain tumors. Sandostatin is also used to treat chronic watery diarrhea associated with <a href="../../simple/crypto.html">cryptosporidiosis</a>, microsporidiosis and intestinal amoebiasis. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Sandostatin may lower blood sugar levels. Your ability to absorb dietary fats may be reduced. Other side effects may include constipation, gas, hepatitis, jaundice, rectal spasms, GI bleeding, swollen stomach, heartburn, fluttering sensation and abnormal stools. You may experience hair loss, thinning of skin, skin flaking, bruising, bleeding, rash, backache, muscle pain, cramping, joint pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, high blood pressure, anxiety, loss of appetite, depression, drowsiness, loss of balance, pounding in head, irritability, inability to sleep, loss of sex drive, forgetfulness, nervousness, shakiness, dry mouth, numbness, chills, fever, throat discomfort, and the sensation of eyes burning.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>The initial dose is 50 mcg, administered subcutaneously, once or twice daily. After that, the number of injections and dosage may be increased gradually based on tolerance and response. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Resolution of symptoms indicates that treatment is working.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>If you are taking Sandostatin, you should be monitored by your doctor for gallbladder disease. Surgical intervention has been necessary, although infrequent, in people who have developed severe abdominal pain while taking Sandostatin. Notify your doctor immediately if you have strong pains in your stomach area. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk, so caution should be used if taken when breast feeding. Multiple injections at the same site within short periods of time should be avoided. Blood sugar levels should be monitored by you and your doctor. If you are insulin-dependent, a reduction in insulin may be required.  Periodic stool tests should be performed. </p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>ofloxacin (Floxin)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Ofloxacin is an anti-infective drug used for the treatment of lower respiratory infections, skin infection, and urinary tract infections including prostatitis, gonorrhea, cervicitis and urethritis. Ofloxacin has broad activity against bacterial infections and is used in combination with other drugs to treat tuberculosis.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Common side effects include restlessness, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Less common are unpleasant taste, decreased appetite, dry mouth, rash, tremors, confusion, sleep disorders, nervousness, drowsiness, hallucinations, dizziness, and photophobia, which is a strong reaction to bright light. Seizures can be fatal if not treated promptly.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Administration with antacids, iron salts, sucralfate, or zinc salts decreases absorption. Ofloxacin is given in pill form, 200-400 mg every 12 hours on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals with a full glass of water. Do not take with food.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Symptoms should improve within a few days. Length of time for complete resolution depends on the type and site of infection.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Drink at least 2 quarts of high calorie fluids such as juices and nectars per day to prevent crystal formation in the urine. Antacids or iron should not be taken within 2 hours of ofloxacin. Avoid driving or other activities requiring alertness. Wear sunglasses and avoid prolonged exposure to bright light to prevent photophobia. Rinse your mouth frequently, practice good oral hygiene and use sugarless gum or candy to reduce symptoms of dry mouth.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: PAS</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>para aminosalicyclic acid (PAS)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>PAS is an oral anti-mycobacterial drug used as treatment in combination with other drugs for multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). TB is a chronic bacterial infection. TB causes more deaths worldwide than any other infectious disease. TB is spread through the air and usually affects the lungs, although other organs are sometimes involved. Some 1.7 billion people - one-third of the world’s population - are infected with the predominant TB organism, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Most people infected with this bacteria never develop active TB. However, in persons with weakened immune systems, especially those infected with HIV, TB may overcome the body’s defenses, multiply and cause active disease.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Side effects are primarily gastrointestinal such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and anorexia.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>In the treatment of clinical TB, PAS should not be given alone. The usual adult dosage is 10-12 g/kg daily in 2 or 3 equally divided doses. Compliance should be promoted on a voluntary basis through positive incentives such as giving hot meals, providing child care and even giving cash payments to those individuals who come to healthcare facilities to take their medicine under the supervision of a healthcare professional. Directly observed therapy (DOT) is the process by which a healthcare professional monitors the taking of TB drugs.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>People who have TB must take drugs an average of five times per day, and maintenance therapy often continues for more than a year after an individual is no longer sick. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. In the case of MDR-TB, people may take over a dozen pills and a shot each day. Some of these drugs produce serious nausea and drowsiness. If you’re having trouble sticking to your drug schedule, call The Network for help in finding a TB therapy program that can help.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Drugs that can help reduce the symptoms of nausea include Compazine, Phenergan, and Reglan. Eating dry salty foods like crackers can also help with nausea and vomiting. </p>

<title>ADAP drugs: paromomycin</title>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/paro.html">paromomycin</a> (Humatin)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Paromomycin is used to treat diarrhea in people who are infected with <a href="../../simple/crypto.html">cryptosporidiosis</a> (crypto) or intestinal amoebiasis. Cryptosporidiosis is caused by a tiny organism which invades the intestinal tract. Crypto is one of the most common and certainly the most devastating gastrointestinal infection in people with HIV. Infection can occur with T4 cell counts under 100. The severity and duration of crypto are directly dependent on the immune status of the person infected. The primary symptom is diarrhea, which is profuse, watery, non-bloody, and often chronic. Infection is often accompanied by accelerated weight loss, as much as 20-30 percent of total body weight within a few weeks. Vomiting and crampy abdominal pain, at times severe, occur frequently as the illness persists. Anorexia, flatulence, and muscle aches occur, but fever is unusual.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Adverse GI effects of paromomycin include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, gastric burning and pain, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Paromomycin is taken orally, usually with or after meals. For treatment of intestinal amoebiasis, the usual dose in adults and children is 25-35 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Treatment is for 5-10 days.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>In addition to drug therapy, nutrition therapy includes increasing fluids, avoiding coffee, caffeine-containing sodas and alcohol, eating small frequent meals, and reducing roughage, dairy products and fats. Your nutrition may need to be supported with dietary supplements or intravenous feeding during episodes of chronic diarrhea and weight loss.</p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/pent.html">pentamidine</a></h1>
<h3 align=center>(aerosolized pentamidine, Nebupent, Pentam)</h3>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Pentamidine is a treatment for PCP pneumonia. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, commonly referred to as PCP, can affect the lungs as well as other parts of the body, including the skin and internal organs. People who are at the greatest risk of contracting this type of pneumonia are those who have less than 200 T4 cells. Symptoms of PCP include shortness of breath, dry cough, and fever. PCP seems to occur very frequently in women as a first or second AIDS-defining illness. Diagnosis in women is often delayed and the illness may be severe by the time it is detected. Pentamidine is used as an inhaled aerosol for prevention of PCP. Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals, who makes Nebupent, has a <a href="../pa/pent.html">Reimbursement Service</a>. Call (800) 366-6323 for more information.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Anxiety, headache, bronchospasm, cough, and chills are some side effects you may experience from treatment with aerosol pentamidine. IV pentamidine can cause leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. You must discontinue <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a> until you are stable on pentamidine. <a href="dida.html">ddI</a> should be discontinued while on IV pentamidine. IV pentamidine may increase the risk of pancreatitis, low blood sugar levels that can be sudden and life-threatening, kidney problems, heart rhythm problems and nausea.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Injections for adults and children are 4/mg/kg once daily for 14 days, longer in people with AIDS. Prevention is 300/mg by Respigard II inhaler every four weeks. Injection is given slowly over 1 hour. Inhaler administration takes approximately 30-45 minutes.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Treatment is effective when you see resolution of the signs and symptoms of PCP infection.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>If you are taking IV pentamidine at home, you must watch for blood sugar changes. It is wise to monitor your blood sugar levels several times throughout the day. This is done with treated strips of paper that react to urine. Notify your doctor immediately if fever, sore throat, signs of infection, bleeding gums, unusual bruising, or blood in stools or urine occur. Do not drink alcohol or take aspirin.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: pentoxifylline</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>pentoxifylline (Trental)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Pentoxifylline is used to lower blood levels of the cytokine called tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNF is produced by immune system cells in response to infection. When TNF is present in significant amounts in the bloodstream, severe weight loss may occur. TNF also interferes with the antiretroviral effects of <a href="zido.html">AZT</a> and <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a>. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Headache, tremor, dizziness, bad digestion, nausea, and vomiting are the most common side effects.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Adults take 400 mg 3 times per day.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Improvement should be seen in 2-4 weeks.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Take with meals to minimize GI irritation. Tablets should be swallowed whole. Do not crush, break, or chew. Avoid driving and other activities requiring alertness. Avoid smoking because nicotine constricts blood vessels. Notify your doctor if nausea, vomiting, GI upset, drowsiness, dizziness, or headache persists because the dosage may need to be reduced.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: prednisone</title>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>prednisone</h1>
<h3 align=center>(Deltasone, Liquid Pred, Metocorten, Orasone, Panasol, Prednicen-M, Sterapred)</h3>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>A short-term course of prednisone is used to treat symptomatic myopathy. Myopathy means muscle disease, and can result in progressive weakness, particularly in the legs. Prednisone suppresses muscle inflammation and the normal immune response.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Long-term use of prednisone can lead to adrenal suppression. Side effects of treatment with prednisone can be depression, euphoria, hypertension, nausea, anorexia, high blood sugar levels, and increased susceptibility to infection. Prednisone must be used cautiously in HIV+ people because the drug is immunosuppressive and can increase the risk of getting opportunistic infections.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Prednisone comes in solution, syrup and tablet form. Maintenance doses may be given once daily or every other day. Adults take 2.5-15 mg 2-4 times daily. Children take .14-2 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Effectiveness of treatment can be seen in suppression of the inflammatory and immune responses in autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions and organ transplants. Treatment should not be stopped without medical supervision and if you’ve been on it for a period of a year, you may need supplementation at times of high stress such as surgery or serious illness until your adrenal glands recover their function.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Use of other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, alcohol or aspirin increases risk of adverse GI effects. Take with meals to minimize gastric irritation. Best taken in morning to coincide with the body’s normal secretion of cortisol. If you are on long-term therapy, eat a diet high in protein, calcium, potassium, low in sodium and moderate in carbohydrates. Monitor your blood sugar levels daily. Avoid people with known contagious illnesses and report possible infections to your doctor. Tell your doctor if you have severe abdominal pain or black stools, and also report any unusual swelling, weight gain, tiredness, bone pain, bruising, non-healing sores, visual disturbances, or behavior changes.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: primaquine</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>primaquine (Primaquine Phosphate)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Primaquine is a treatment for malaria. Primaquine is also used in combination with clindamycin for treating mild to moderate PCP pneumonia when first choice treatments are not tolerated or not working well. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, commonly referred to as PCP, can affect the lungs as well as other parts of the body, including the skin and internal organs. People who are at the greatest risk of contracting this type of pneumonia are those who have less than 200 T4 cells. Symptoms of PCP include shortness of breath, dry cough, and fever. PCP seems to occur very frequently in women as a first or second AIDS-defining illness. Diagnosis in women is often delayed and the illness may be severe by the time it is detected. Studies are ongoing to determine the usefulness and safety of combined treatment with primaquine and clindamycin.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>The combination of primaquine and <a href="clin.html">clindamycin</a> is generally well tolerated. Nausea, vomiting and stomach cramps occasionally occur. Other side effects can be anemia, headache, visual disturbance and intense itching.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Combination therapy with oral primaquine at 15 or 30 mg daily with clindamycin given intravenously or orally at 1.8-3.6 g in 3 or 4 divided doses daily is effective in treating PCP.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Treatment for PCP is 21 days. Most people show improvement in 2-7 days.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Adverse gastrointestinal effects may be reduced by taking primaquine with meals.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: procarbazine</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>procarbazine (Matulane)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Procarbazine is used in combination with other chemotherapies to treat Hodgkin’s disease.  Hodgkin’s disease is a cancer of the lymph nodes. The immune system is made up of organs located throughout the body, generally called lymphoid organs because they are involved in making lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that play an important role in immune function. Lymphoid organs include bone marrow, spleen, thymus gland, lymph nodes, tonsils, appendix, and clumps of cells in the small intestines called Peyer’s patches. A lymphoma is any abnormal, uncontrolled growth of lymphocytes. Lymphomas are cancerous. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Neuropathy, confusion, cough, swelling, nausea, and vomiting are the most common side effects. Procarbazine should not be used for treatment if pregnant or breast feeding, if alcoholism, severe kidney or liver impairment are problems, or at the same time as meperidine (Demerol). CNS depression is possible if procarbazine is used with alcohol, antidepressants, antihistamines, narcotic pain killers and sedatives. Eating foods high in tyramine may result in abnormally high blood pressure. Foods high in tyramine include aged cheeses, avocados, bananas, beer, caffeinated beverages, chocolate, sausages, liver, over-ripe fruit, red wine, smoked or pickled fish, yeast, and yogurt.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Adults take 100-150 mg/m2/day for 10 days by mouth, followed by a maintenance dose of 50-100 mg/day or 2-4 mg/kg/day for 1 week, then 4-6 mg/kg/day until response is obtained. Children take 50 mg/m2/day for 7 days, then 100 mg/m2/day, and a maintenance dose of 50 mg/day.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Effectiveness of treatment can be determined by decrease in size and spread of malignant tissue.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Antiemetics may help with nausea. Compazine and Dramamine are antiemetics. There are others. Your doctor will prescribe the best one for you. Notify your doctor promptly if fever, sore throat, signs of infection, bleeding gums, bruising, vomiting, small hemorrhage spots in the skin, or blood in stools or urine. Do not drink alcohol or take aspirin as they may cause gastric bleeding. Alcohol can also cause flushing, nausea, vomiting, headache, and abdominal cramps. Notify your doctor if confusion, cough, burning or prickling on the skin, unsteady gait, severe headache, rash, jaundice, or diarrhea occur.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: PZA</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>pyrazinamide (PZA)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Pyrazinamide is part of a multidrug regimen for treating TB infection. TB can be detected by a skin test that becomes positive a few weeks after infection. The test is performed in a doctor’s office by inserting a small amount of tuberculin antigen under the skin. The antigen is called purified protein derivative (PPD), and the TB skin test is often called a PPD. TB generally appears within the first six to twelve months after infection. If treated, TB is almost always curable. Although the disease may be more rapidly progressive and more widely disseminated in people with AIDS, it responds just as well to drugs as in HIV-negative people with TB infection.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Liver toxicity, rash, kidney dysfunction, and eye disease.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Pyrazinamide is taken orally, 20 to 30 mg/kg per day in 3 or 4 equally divided doses not to exceed 3 g daily. Dosages up to 60 mg/kg daily have been used in the treatment of isoniazid-resistant TB. Tests to determine how well the drug is working should be taken periodically and the medication changed if the infection develops resistance to a particular drug. You may find it difficult to take multiple drugs consistently over a period of many months, but compliance with TB treatment is very important. If you do not finish the recommended course of TB drugs, a strain of multiple drug resistant TB (MDRTB) can develop which is very difficult to treat and can be contagious. TB is unlikely to recur if you take your drugs faithfully for the period your doctor recommends.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Pyrazinamide is taken for two months. Other drugs for TB maintenance treatment are taken for as long as two years. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Side effects are generally tolerable, except for liver toxicity, which may require adjustment of drugs.</p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>pyrimethamine (Daraprim, Fansidar)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Pyrimethamine is used for the treatment and prevention of malaria. Pyrimethamine is also used to treat AIDS-related diarrhea and as one of a combination of drugs to treat Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoal infection. Many HIV+ have been exposed to toxoplasmosis (toxo), but are able to keep the infection in check until their immune systems become relatively weak. People can become infected with the toxo organism by coming in contact with feces, frequently found in dirt. Symptoms include headaches, fever, confusion, lack of energy, and, in some cases, inflammation of parts of the eyes. Toxo can also cause loss of mental status, seizures and paralysis. Toxoplasmosis can become resistant or unresponsive to existing treatments. Glaxo-Wellcome, Inc., which makes Daraprim, has an <a href="../pa/pyri.html">HIV Patient Assistance Program</a> - call (800) 722-9294.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Folic acid deficiency can cause a painful burning tongue, loss of taste, and anemia. Other side effects can be skin rash, fever, nervousness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bone marrow depression, and jaundice.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Pyrimethamine comes in tablets combined with sulfad<a href="sulf.html"></a>oxine called Fansidar. For treatment of Isosporiasis infection, adults take 50-75 mg of pyrimethamine daily, as needed to control or eliminate infection. For treatment of toxoplasmosis, usual dose is 25 mg daily. For AIDS related toxo, treatment begins with a loading dose of 100-200 mg in 2 divided doses daily for the first 2 days, then 50-75 mg daily. Maintenance treatment is 25 mg per day, sulfadiazine 4 grams per day, and <a href="leuc.html">leucovorin</a> 10 mg per day.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>For maintenance, treatment is ongoing. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. For controlling malaria or toxo, continual use on a regular schedule for 4-6 weeks is usually necessary.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Take with food if necessary to reduce stomach irritation. Take with a full glass of water or juice. Drug should be discontinued immediately if a skin rash or itching develops. Leucovorin should be taken daily to prevent anemia.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/rifa.html">rifabutin</a> (Ansamycin, Mycobutin)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Rifabutin is used in combination with other drugs for prevention and treatment of <a href="../../simple/mac.html">MAC</a>. A number of different drugs are being tried for prevention and maintenance treatment of MAC. MAC is related to tuberculosis (TB), but no one anti-TB drug works against MAC. Maintenance therapy after an episode of MAC is now routine, though it is not known which of the existing treatments is most effective. Recent Public Health Service recommendations suggest either <a href="clar.html">clarithromycin</a> or <a href="azit.html">azithromycin</a> as the first line treatment for MAC,  along with at least one other drug, usually <a href="etha.html">ethambuto</a>l and one of the following: <a href="clof.html">clofazimine</a>, <a href="cipr.html">ciprofloxacin</a>, or rifabutin. Multidrug therapy reduces mycobacterial colony counts in blood and leads to clinical improvement, especially the reduction of fever. Preventive treatment for MAC is recommended in people with less than 75 T4 cells. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Possible kidney and liver effects, bone marrow suppression, rash, fever, gastrointestinal distress, uveitis (a swelling of the eye). Rifabutin can also cause an orange discoloration of the urine, sweat and tears.  Soft contact lenses can become permanently discolored. Taking rifabutin and clarithromycin together raises the level of rifabutin in the body which increases the risk of side effects.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Rifabutin comes in 150 mg capsules. Dosage for preventive treatment is 300 mg daily. Rifabutin is likely to have similar drug interactions to <a href="rifam.html">rifampin</a> which interacts with <a href="keto.html">ketoconazole</a> and reduces the effectiveness of both drugs to subtherapeutic doses. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>The drug usually helps with symptoms in two to four weeks. Ongoing maintenance treatment is necessary. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Drugs that can help reduce the symptoms of nausea include Compazine, Phenergan, and Reglan. Nutrition strategies such as eating dry salted crackers and not lying down right after you eat can help with stomach upset and nausea. Early warning signs of kidney problems are decreased urination, increased thirst, or light-headedness after you stand up. Kidney problems can generally be treated. One of the purposes of frequent and repeated blood tests when you are severely ill is to make sure that your kidneys are working well. If blood tests show signs of any potential problems, treatment can begin promptly. Treatment often requires adjusting doses of certain drugs, decreasing your fluid intake, and following a special diet for kidney failure.  When taking rifabutin, be sure to notify immediately of any eye problems or changes in vision.</p>

<h1 align=center>rifampin</h1>
<h3 align=center>(RIF, Rifampicin, Rifadin, Rimactane)</h3>
</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Rifampin is a treatment for <a href="../../simple/mac.html">MAC</a> and TB infections. Maintenance therapy after an episode of MAC is now routine, though it is not known which of the existing treatments is most effective. Multidrug therapy reduces mycobacterial colony counts in blood and leads to clinical improvement, especially the reduction of fevers. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Chills, difficult breathing, dizziness, fever, headache, muscle and bone pain, rash, itching, sore throat, yellow eyes or skin, unusual bleeding or bruising, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, unusual tiredness or weakness, bloody or cloudy urine, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and sore mouth or tongue. Urine, feces, saliva, sputum, sweat or tears may become red-orange to red-brown in color. Soft contact lenses may become permanently discolored. </p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Rifampin comes in pill and injectable forms. The drug is usually taken orally. Dosage is 600 mg per day or 450 mg per day for people weighing less than 50 kg. Rifampin interacts with <a href="keto.html">ketoconazole</a> in the body and can reduce the effectiveness of both drugs. Rifampin reduces the effectiveness of methadone and may lead to withdrawal symptoms. Rifampin lowers serum <a href="daps.html">dapsone</a> levels, so the two drugs should not be used together. Rifampin can decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>If you have latent but inactive TB and you are under 35 years old, you must be treated for at least one to two years with rifampin if you cannot tolerate standard treatment with isoniazid or other TB treatments. Ongoing maintenance treatment for MAC is necessary. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. You should experience increased appetite, weight gain, reduced fatigue, and a sense of well-being with treatment.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Take the drug on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. If GI irritation becomes a problem, rifampin can be taken with food. Antacids may also be taken 1 hour before taking drug. Capsules may be opened and contents mixed with applesauce or jelly for people who have difficulty swallowing. The pharmacist can make a syrup for people who are unable to swallow solids. Avoid alcohol during this therapy because alcohol increases the chance of damage to the liver.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: ritonavir (Norvir)</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/rito.html">ritonavir</a> (Norvir)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Ritonavir (trade name Norvir, also known as ABT-538) is one of a new group of anti-HIV drugs called <a href="../../simple/protease.html">protease inhibitors</a>. These drugs work by blocking a part of HIV called protease. When protease is blocked, HIV makes copies of itself that can't infect new cells. In a study in people with less than 100 T4 cells, ritonavir was found to help people live longer, and delay progression of disease. Researchers recommend taking ritonavir with at least one other nucleoside analog anti-HIV drug (<a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a>, <a href="stav.html">d4T</a> or <a href="lami.html">3TC</a>). For the strongest anti-HIV effect ritonavir should be taken with two nucleoside analogs. Ritonavir can effect the way other drugs are absorbed by the body. There is a long <a href="../../../natap/drug/norvir.html">list of drugs</a> that may be affected on the package insert that comes with ritonavir. It is very important that anyone about to start taking ritonavir goes over this list thoroughly with their healthcare provider. Some of the drug interactions are potentially life-threatening.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>The major side effects seen in ritonavir studies were nausea, vomiting, weakness and diarrhea. Other side effects that have been associated with the drug are numbing sensations around the mouth and elevated liver enzymes. Now that the drug is approved, people are reporting that these side effects may be very common and more severe than had been thought.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>The recommended dosage is 600 mg twice a day. If you <a href="../../../pwahg/info/norvir.html">can't take the full dose</a>, the lowest dose that can be used is 500 mg twice a day, and this must be in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. Ritonavir comes in capsule and liquid formulations. The capsules must be kept refrigerated and protected from light. Refrigeration of the liquid is also recommended, but not required if kept in a cool place and used within 30 days.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Maintenance treatment is necessary unless resistance or intolerance to drug occurs, at which time you may be switched to other anti-HIV drugs. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug or drugs to control an infection so that you don't become ill.</p>
<h3>
Managing side effects</h3>

<p>The company that makes ritonavir, Abbott Laboratories, recommends <a href="../../../pwahg/info/norvir.html">building up the dose</a> of ritonavir slowly over a few days when first starting the drug. People can start at 300 mg twice a day, and then move on to 400 mg twice a day after a few days, continuing until you reach the recommended dose of 600 mg twice a day. It is very important that you take no more than 14 days to build up the dose, as this could help HIV get resistant to the effects of the drug. The drug should also be taken with a full high-protein, high-fat meal if possible. Anecdotal reports also suggest that taking ritonavir right after a meal with yogurt may help reduce side effects. If side effects continue and you cannot tolerate the drug, it may be an idea to consider another protease inhibitor such as <a href="indi.html">indinavir</a> (Crixivan) or <a href="saqu.html">saquinavir</a> (Invirase).</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: saquinavir (Invirase)</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/saqu.html">saquinavir</a> (Invirase)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Saquinavir (trade name Invirase) is the first <a href="../../simple/protease.html">protease inhibitor</a> to be approved for the treatment of HIV infection. Protease inhibitors are a new class of anti-HIV drugs. They work by blocking a part of HIV called protease. When protease is blocked, HIV makes copies of itself that can't infect new cells. Saquinavir has been approved for use by people over 13 with under 300 T4 cells, in combination with one or more of the approved nucleoside analog drugs (<a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="stav.html">d4T</a> and <a href="lami.html">3TC</a>). There is no information on the use of saquinavir in children. Saquinavir, in the current formulation, is not very well absorbed by the body. A <a href="../../trials/hiv.html#14182">new soft gelatin version</a> of the drug is being studied that will hopefully be better absorbed.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Compared to the nucleoside analog drugs, saquinavir seems to have few side effects. In studies, the most common side effects, occurring in very few people, were diarrhea, stomach discomfort and nausea.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>The current recommended dosage is 1,800 mg day. Saquinavir should be taken after a full meal. One small study found that ordinary reconstituted frozen grapefruit juice could help increase the levels of saquinavir in the body. People in the study drank a small (150ml) glass of the grapefruit juice with their saquinavir, followed by another glass an hour later. Drug levels were increased by about 50%. When people made the grapefruit juice stronger by mixing it with half the amount of water, the levels of saquinavir in their bodies doubled. However, grapefruit juice may affect other drugs, and this could be dangerous. The acidity of grapefruit juice may also irritate the stomach. If you are thinking of using grapefruit juice to boost the levels of saquinavir in your body, talk about it with your doctor.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Maintenance treatment is necessary unless resistance or intolerance to drug occurs, at which time you may be switched to other anti-HIV drugs. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug or drugs to control an infection so that you don't become ill.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

Over-the-counter anti-diarrheals may help if diarrhea is an ongoing problem. Be sure to check with your doctor before taking an anti-diarrheal. The doctor may want to check that the diarrhea isn't being caused by something else, like an infection. Saquinavir should not be taken with the antibiotics <a href="rifam.html">rifampin</a> or <a href="rifa.html">rifabutin</a> (Mycobutin) as these drugs greatly reduce the amount of saquinavir in the body. The antifungal drug <a href="keto.html">ketaconazole</a> has been shown to slightly increase the level of saquinavir in the body. Other antifungal drugs such as <a href="fluc.html">fluconazole</a> (Diflucan) and <a href="itra.html">itraconazole</a> may also have this effect.

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/sarg.html">sargramostim</a></h1>
<h3 align=center>(Leukine, Prokine, GM-CSF)</h3>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Sargramostim is used to treat non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas and acute leukemia. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) are a category of cancers that have become increasingly common in people with AIDS. As treatment improves, HIV+ people are living longer with severe immune suppression. Because of this, NHL is becoming more common. In NHL, the majority of lymphomas are due to uncontrolled growth of B-lymphocytes. Sargramostim is also used for people who have had bone marrow transplants whose effectiveness has been delayed or failed. Sargramostim is a growth factor that principally stimulates production of cells in the bone marrow, and is used to treat depression of bone marrow function due to HIV infection or drugs. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Possible side effects include headaches, fevers and flushing. In using sargramostim to treat people with HIV infection, there is concern that sargramostim may help spread HIV further throughout the body. Sargramostim stimulates macrophages, a crucial part of the immune system, and macrophages may be infected with HIV. </p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Sargramostim is given by IV injection over 2 hours. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Sargramostim treatment for individuals who have had bone marrow transplants is for 14 days and then discontinued for 7 days. If after this 7 day period, the graft has still not taken, a second 14 day course of treatment may be given. Dose may be increased for a third course of treatment, but if no improvement is seen after the third course of sargramostim therapy, alternative treatment will be necessary.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>If malignancy progression is observed during treatment, the drug should be discontinued. If severe adverse reaction occurs, dosage of the drug should be reduced or temporarily discontinued.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/stav.html">stavudine</a> (d4T, Zerit)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Stavudine is an antiretroviral drug approved by the FDA for people who are unable to take <a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="dida.html">ddI</a> or <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a>. Like AZT, stavudine partially crosses the blood-brain barrier, and HIV virus strains resistant to AZT are often still susceptible to stavudine. Compared to AZT, stavudine is less toxic to cells of the bone marrow. An early study showed that stavudine had significant toxicities at higher dosages. Recent encouraging information on stavudine has led some doctors to use it as first line therapy against HIV. Combinations of stavudine with other anti-HIV drugs such as AZT, ddI and <a href="../../simple/three.html">3TC</a> are being <a href="../../trials/hiv.html">studied</a>.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Stomach upset, peripheral neuropathy, and elevated liver function tests. Some people have complained of insomnia (difficulty sleeping) and feeling hyperactive. Pancreatitis, a dangerous swelling of an organ in the body called the pancreas, has also been associated with the drug. At higher doses than are now being used, toxic side effects include a severe shortage of red blood cells which require transfusions, and increased levels of liver enzymes suggesting liver toxicity. There is some concern over potential neurological side effects. A community registry in San Francisco is currently collecting information on any changes in mood experienced by people taking this drug.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Stavudine is taken in a pill form. The standard dose is 40mg twice a day for people weighing more than 60kg and 30mg for those that weigh less. This can be lowered to 20 mg or 15mg if side effects are a problem. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>As with other anti-HIV drugs, ongoing maintenance therapy is usually prescribed. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug or drugs to try and control the infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Peripheral neuropathy shows up as painful burning or tingling sensations in the hands or feet. Pancreatits can appear as a pain in the stomach area that goes through to your back. If you get these symptoms notify your doctor immediately as it may require lower dosage or changing to a different anti-HIV drug.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>streptomycin (Streptomycin sulfate)</h1>

</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Streptomycin is an antibiotic used in combination with other drugs to treat tuberculosis (TB). TB is a chronic bacterial infection. TB causes more deaths worldwide than any other infectious disease. TB is spread through the air and usually affects the lungs, although other organs are sometimes involved. Some 1.7 billion people - one-third of the world’s population - are infected with the predominant TB organism, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Most people infected with M. tuberculosis never develop active TB. However, in persons with weakened immune systems, especially those infected with the HIV virus, TB may overcome the body’s defenses, multiply and cause active disease. While streptomycin is no longer considered a first line treatment for TB, some strains of multi-drug resistant TB (MDRTB) are susceptible to treatment. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, rash and fever. Loss of hearing has been reported following long term use. Streptomycin should not be used in anyone with kidney impairment because it increases the risk of severe toxic reactions.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Streptomycin is given by intramuscular injection. Adults are given 1 g daily in combination with 5 g of PAS and 200-300 mg of isoniazid. Ultimately the streptomycin should be stopped or reduced to 1 g two to three times weekly. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>The total period of treatment for TB is a minimum of 1 year. Indication for stopping streptomycin may occur at any time earlier due to toxic symptoms, or if the infection becomes resistant to the drug.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Symptoms subside and recovery is usually complete after you stop taking the drug. Roaring noises, or ringing in the ears are signs that treatment with streptomycin should be stopped.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: sulfadiazine</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>sulfadiazine (Microsulfon)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Sulfadiazine is a sulfa drug used in combination with <a href="pyri.html">pyrimethamine</a> and <a href="leuc.html">leucovorin</a> as maintenance treatment to prevent recurrence of toxoplasmosis. When the immune system becomes weak - typically when a person has below 100 T4 cells - toxoplasmosis becomes active and causes disease.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Many people have allergies to sulfa drugs and get rashes and fevers. Other side effects are suppression of white blood cells, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Kidney problems can also develop. The drug forms crystals in the kidneys which can lead to blockage and kidney failure.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Sulfadiazine comes in 500 mg tablets. You must discontinue <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a> until you are stable on sulfadiazine. Sulfadiazine is given in combination with pyrimethamine. The two drugs must be used together to be effective. The drugs are used at relatively high dosage, leading to a strong likelihood of side effects. These drugs cross the blood-brain barrier and can treat toxoplasmosis infection in the brain. The usual dose of sulfadiazine is 2-8 g daily in adults and 100-200 mg/kg daily in children. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Treatment usually is continued for 3-4 weeks. Longer treatment of up to 6 months may be required in people with AIDS. These drugs kill the form of the parasite that causes active disease, but do not kill that form that is the reservoir of infection. Relapse occurs in 50 percent of people who stop taking the drugs. For this reason it is important to continue on maintenance treatment, which is often a lower dose of the combination of pyrimethamine and the sulfa drug <a href="tmp.html">Bactrim</a>. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Drink lots of fluids to prevent crystal formation in the kidneys. The effect of <a href="zido.html">AZT</a> on toxoplasmosis is not entirely clear but seems beneficial and without problems in combination with drugs for toxoplasmosis. Since AZT and the pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine combination both can cause neutropenia, regular monitoring for this side effect is important when using these drugs together.</p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>sulfadoxine (Fansidar)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Sulfadoxine is an antibiotic that has been used to prevent PCP. It may also be effective in preventing toxoplasmosis. Sulfadoxine appears to be effective against PCP, but in rare and unpredictable cases it can have very dangerous and even fatal side effects, in some instances an allergic response called Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Use of <a href="tmp.html">Bactrim</a>, <a href="daps.html">dapsone</a>, or <a href="pent.html">aerosolized pentamidine</a> is preferable.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Stevens-Johnson syndrome, skin allergies, liver damage, high fever and weakness, anemia, sensitivity to light, bleeding and/or bruising, folic acid deficiency (loss of taste, inflammation of the tongue, diarrhea, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, inflammation of the mouth), skin rash, fatigue, aching in joints or muscles, red blood cells in the urine, difficult or painful urination, goiter, tremors, seizures, headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p><a href="pyri.html">Pyrimethamine</a> comes in tablets combined with sulfadoxine. For treatment of isosporiasis, adults take 50-75 mg of pyrimethamine daily, as needed to control or eliminate infection. For treatment of toxoplasmosis, usual dose is 25 mg daily. For AIDS related toxoplasmosis, treatment begins with a loading dose of 100-200 mg in 2 divided doses daily for the first 2 days, then 50-75 mg daily. Maintenance treatment is 25 mg per day, sulfadiazine 4 grams per day, and leucovorin 10 mg per day.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>For maintenance, treatment is ongoing. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug to control an infection so that you don't become ill. For controlling malaria or toxoplasmosis, continual use on a regular schedule for 4-6 weeks is usually necessary.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p><a href="leuc.html">Leucovorin</a>, a folinic acid, is used to control folic acid deficiency from treatment with sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine. Serious drug reactions can be controlled if they are treated promptly with Benadryl and steroids.</p>

<h1 align=center>sulfamethazine</h1>
<h3 align=center>(Triple Sulfa, Dayto Sulf, Gyne-Sulf, Sultrin, Trysul, VVS)</h3>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Sulfamethazine is one of a class of drugs called sulfonamides used in combination to treat a variety of infections. At one time, sulfonamides were widely used in the treatment and prevention of infections such as urinary tract infections, chlamydia, rheumatic fever, toxoplasmosis and malaria. The development of resistance in many of these organisms has greatly limited the clinical usefulness of these drugs.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Adverse effects of the sulfonamides are numerous and may involve nearly all organ systems. Some of the side effects are hypersensitivity, rash, intense itching of the skin, photosensitivity, high fever, severe headache, inflammation of the mouth, liver damage, kidney damage, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea, GI bleeding, headache, dizziness, vertigo, mental depression, hallucinations, confusion, seizures, ringing in the ears, drowsiness, restlessness and insomnia.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Sulfonamides are given orally or intravaginally. Dosage should be determined individually according to the severity of the infection, the drug being used, and the response and tolerance of the patient. The usual dosage of triple sulfa cream for intravaginal administration is one full applicator of vaginal cream twice daily for 4-6 days. Dosage may then be decreased to 1/2 to 1/4 of an full applicator twice daily. Alternatively, one triple sulfa vaginal tablet may be inserted before retiring and in the morning for 10 days. A second course of treatment may be taken if necessary.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>For vaginal infections, treatment is for 10 days. Prolonged therapy for up to 6 months or longer is necessary for treatment of toxoplasmosis in people with AIDS.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Wear protective clothing and avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight. If photosensitivity or a rash develop, the drug should be stopped at once.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>trimethoprim (Proloprim, Trimpex)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>For people with HIV disease, this drug is usually given in a combination form for prevention of PCP. The combination form is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or <a href="tmp.html">TMP/SMX</a>. The brand names for this drug are Bactrim and Septra. Trimethoprim is used in combination with dapsone to treat PCP. Trimethoprim alone is used at lower doses to treat upper respiratory infections and uncomplicated urinary tract infections.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Bleeding, headache, skin rash, itching, alteration in taste, sore mouth or tongue, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and cramping. High doses of trimethoprim may cause hyperkalemia, which is abnormally high levels of potassium in the blood. The drug impedes the passage of potassium into the urine.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Adults take 100 mg every 12 hours or 200 mg as a single daily dose. Taking rifampin at the same time may decrease trimethoprim’s effectiveness. Treatment with trimethoprim with chemotherapy or radiation therapy increases risk of bone marrow suppression.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Treatment is usually required for 10-14 days before symptoms resolve.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Take on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals with a full glass of water. You may take trimethoprim with food if GI irritation occurs. People with kidney problems need to watch for high levels of potassium in the blood. If the kidney problems persist, you may need to restrict foods that are high in potassium and also take drugs to lower your serum potassium level.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: TMP/SMX</title>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>TMP/SMX (<a href="../pa/tmp-b.html">Bactrim</a>, <a href="../pa/tmp-s.html">Septra</a>)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the chemical name for a commonly used compound of two antibiotics. One of the manufacturers’ brand names is Bactrim. Bactrim has been safely and effectively used for many years to treat common respiratory infections, and is also prescribed to people who have sinusitis. Bactrim is used for prevention and treatment of PCP pneumonia. Oral Bactrim is delivered throughout the body and is evenly spread throughout lung tissue. Bactrim may be effective in preventing and treating some other infections that occur in HIV disease, such as toxoplasmosis, salmonella, shigella, and sinusitis. Glaxo-Wellcome, Inc., who makes Septra, has an <a href="../pa/tmp-s.html">HIV Patient Assistance Program</a> that can be reached at (800) 722-9294. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., who makes Bactrim, has a <a href="../pa/tmp-b.html">Reimbursement Assistance</a> program. Call (800) 443-6676.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Like other sulfa drugs, Bactrim can cause allergies, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Allergies typically develop as a widespread itchy red rash with fever eight to fourteen days after beginning the standard dose of Bactrim. Neutropenia, a reduction in the number of neutrophils, can also occur.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>A commonly prescribed dose for PCP prevention is one double-strength tablet of Bactrim taken twice a day, three days a week.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Preventive therapy is ongoing. Preventive treatment means you keep taking the drug to prevent an infection so that you don't become ill. Treatment for active infection is 2 to 3 weeks.  Bactrim may take five to seven days to produce clinical improvement.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Dosages of <a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="ganc.html">ganciclovir</a>, <a href="acyc.html">acyclovir</a> and some drugs used as chemotherapy against cancer may need to be reduced if given in combination with Bactrim to avoid neutropenia. Allergic symptoms such as rash and fever will go away by themselves within a few days after stopping Bactrim. Rash can be reduced by using Benadryl. Corticosteroids, a class of drugs that are powerful suppressants of allergic reactions, can be used if the reaction is especially severe. Notify your doctor if a rash develops. If you are allergic to Bactrim, you may be able to tolerate the drug if you start again at very small doses and then build up gradually. This is called desensitization. Recent studies have shown that around 85% of people who have a reaction at first can be desensitized to this drug.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>triple sulfa</h1>
<h3 align=center>(Dayto Sulf, Gyne-Sulf, Sultrin, Trysul, VVS)</h3>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Triple sulfa is a combination of drugs from the class of drugs called sulfonamides used in combination to treat a variety of infections. At one time sulfonamides were widely used in the treatment and prevention of infections such as urinary tract infections, chlamydia, rheumatic fever, toxoplasmosis and malaria. The development of resistance in many of these organisms has greatly limited the clinical usefulness of these drugs.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Adverse effects of the sulfonamides are numerous and may involve nearly all organ systems. Some of the side effects include hypersensitivity, rash, intense itching of the skin, photosensitivity, high fever, severe headache, inflammation of the mouth, liver damage, kidney damage, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea, GI bleeding, headache, dizziness, mental depression, hallucinations, confusion, seizures, ringing in the ears, drowsiness, restlessness and insomnia.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Sulfonamides are given orally or intravaginally. Dosage should be determined individually according to the severity of the infection, the drug being used, and the response and tolerance of the patient. The usual dosage of triple sulfa cream for intravaginal administration is one  full applicator of vaginal cream twice daily for 4-6 days. Dosage may then be decreased to 1/2 to 1/4 of an  full applicator twice daily. Alternatively, one triple sulfa vaginal tablet may be inserted before going to bed and in the morning for 10 days. A second course of treatment may be necessary.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>For vaginal infections, treatment is 10 days. Prolonged therapy for up to 6 months or longer is necessary for treatment of toxoplasmosis in people with AIDS.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Wear protective clothing and avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight. If rash or photosensitivity develop, the drug should be stopped at once.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: vinblastine</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>vinblastine (Velban, Velsar)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Vinblastine is given intravenously to treat <a href="../../simple/ks.html">KS</a>, often in combination with other drugs. Advances have been made in the treatment of KS, but no optimal therapy or adequate long-term management options have been defined. There is no curative therapy for KS. Vinblastine is also used in combination for treatment of other lymphomas, tumors, and advanced breast cancer.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Fever, chills, cough, hoarseness, lower back pain, side pain, painful or difficult urination, pain or redness at site of injection, sores in mouth and on lips, rectal bleeding, dizziness, difficulty in walking, double vision, drooping eyelids, headache, jaw pain, mental depression, numbness or tingling in fingers and toes, pain in fingers or toes, pain in testicles, weakness, nausea, vomiting, or hair loss. Bronchospasm can be life-threatening and may occur at time of infusion or several hours later. The drug’s major side effect is suppression of bone marrow.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>May vary greatly depending on tumor, schedule, condition of individual and blood counts. Adults are given 3.7 mg/m2 single dose, increased at weekly intervals as tolerated by 1.8 mg/m2 to a maximum of 18.5 mg/m2. Usual maintenance dose is 5.5-7.4 mg/m2. For treatment of KS, vinblastine can be injected directly into the lesion. Side effects of intralesional chemotherapy are local pain and skin irritation.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Treatment is effective if there is regression of malignancy without the appearance of detrimental side effects.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>An antiemetic may be necessary to minimize nausea and vomiting. Compazine and Dramamine are antiemetics. There are others. Your doctor will prescribe the best one for you. Adjust diet as tolerated. Inspect your mouth for redness and ulceration. If ulceration occurs, avoid spicy foods, use sponge brush, and rinse mouth with warm salt water after eating and drinking. Your doctor may order viscous lidocaine swishes. Notify your doctor if fever, chills, vomiting, sore throat, signs of infection, bleeding gums, bruising, small hemorrhagic spots in the skin, or blood in urine or stool occurs. Avoid crowds and persons with known infections. Use a soft toothbrush and electric razor. Don’t drink alcohol or take aspirin. Treatment with <a href="filg.html">G-CSF</a> may correct suppression of bone marrow activity and allow continued use of vinblastine.</p>

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center>vincristine</h1>
<h3 align=center>(Oncovin, Vincasar PES, Vincrex)</h3>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Vincristine is given intravenously to treat <a href="../../simple/ks.html">KS</a> and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. KS has become the fourth most common AIDS-defining illness. Advances have been made in the treatment of KS, but no optimal therapy or adequate long-term management options have been defined. There is no curative therapy for KS. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) are a category of cancers that have become increasingly common in people with AIDS. As treatment improves, HIV+ people are living longer with severe immune suppression. Because of this, NHL is becoming more common. In NHL, the majority of lymphomas are due to uncontrolled growth of B-lymphocytes. Vincristine is used alone and in combination with other chemotherapies. </p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Constipation, stomach cramps, bed wetting, decrease or increase in urination, dizziness, lightheadedness, difficult or painful urination, lack of sweating, joint pain, lower back or side pain, visual changes, difficulty controlling muscle movement, drooping eyelids, headache, jaw pain, numbness or tingling in fingers or toes, pain in testicles, weakness, leukopenia, decrease in number of platelets which can lead to bleeding, and inflammation of the mouth. Vincristine’s major side effect is a reversible peripheral neuropathy.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Adults take 10-30 mcg/kg or 0.4-1.4 mg/m2 which can be repeated once a week, but not to exceed 2 mg each dose. Each single dose is given intravenously over 1 minute.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>Treatment is effective if there is regression of malignancy without the appearance of detrimental side effects.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Increased fluid and fiber intake and increased exercise may minimize constipation. Tell your doctor about any pain, difficulty walking, persistent constipation or abnormal sensation such as burning or prickling on the skin. Contraception should be practiced during and for at least 2 months after treatment is concluded. Vincristine and vinblastine may be used in alternating weeks to reduce dose-limiting toxicity. By alternating the drugs, you can use higher, more effective doses without suffering severe side effects.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: zalcitabine</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/zalc.html">zalcitabine</a> (ddC, Hivid, dideoxycytidine)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>ddC is an antiretroviral like <a href="zido.html">AZT</a> and <a href="dida.html">ddI</a>. Some people who cannot tolerate AZT because of neutropenia or anemia can take ddC, although recent studies indicate that ddC is not as effective as a first line treatment. ddC does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier as well as AZT. ddC is also commonly used in <a href="../../simple/combo.html">combination</a> with AZT. Recent studies indicate that anti-HIV drugs are far more effective when used in combination. If someone has already taken AZT, the combination of AZT and ddI has been shown to be more effective than AZT and ddC in delaying disease progression. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. who makes Hivid, has an <a href="../pa/zalc.html">Assistance Program</a>. Call (800) 285-4484 for more information.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>ddC rarely causes the anemia or suppression of white blood cells that are the major problem with AZT, making it an alternative for people who cannot tolerate AZT. Side effects of ddC can be skin eruptions, canker sores, general inflammation of the mouth, nausea, pancreatitis and fever. These symptoms usually disappear after the first four weeks of using ddC. A serious side effect of ddC is an inflammation of the nerves called peripheral neuropathy. The symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are burning or numbing in the hands or, most often, in the feet. The symptoms may start slowly. Some people develop only mild symptoms while others have to contend with serious pain that makes walking difficult.</p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>Adults take 2.25 mg per day divided into three doses. It is important to divide up doses and space them out evenly over the day in order to maintain adequate levels of ddC in the blood.</p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>As with other anti-HIV drugs, ongoing maintenance therapy is used. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug or drugs to control an infection so that you don't become ill. </p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Antidepressants such as Elavil seem to have effect in treating peripheral neuropathy. Some people also find acupuncture helpful. Local treatment with a salve or tincture can help symptoms that occur in the mouth. If you are starting radiation therapy, <a href="amph.html">amphotericin B</a>, <a href="pyri.html">pyrimethamine</a>, <a href="sulf.html">sulfadiazine</a>, intravenous <a href="tmp.html">Bactrim</a>, ganciclovir, pentamidine, or <a href="acyc.html">acyclovir</a>, you should discontinue ddC until you are stable on the other drugs. Pancreatitis can appear as a pain in the stomach area that goes through to your back. You should notify your doctor immediately if you experience this symptom.</p>

<title>ADAP drugs: zidovudine</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFE8" text="#000000">

<p align=center><img src="../../gifs/access.gif" alt="[logo]"></p>

<h1 align=center><a href="../pa/zido.html">zidovudine</a> (AZT, ZDV, Retrovir)</h1>

<h3>Drug description</h3>

<p>Zidovudine or AZT, was the first drug approved for the treatment of AIDS. Recent studies show that it should not be used alone for any length of time. This is because HIV becomes resistant to the drug more easily when it is used alone. AZT is also approved for the treatment of people who are HIV+ but who do not have any symptoms. AZT may prevent the growth and reproduction of HIV virus which has already infected immune system cells. AZT does not kill the virus inside these cells, but may prevent new cells from being infected. AZT is now being used in <a href="../../simple/combo.html">combination</a> with the other approved anti-HIV drugs. Recent studies indicate promising results from the combination of AZT with the drug <a href="../../simple/three.html">3TC</a>. 3TC has been approved for prescription in combination with AZT for people with less than 500 T4 cells. Glaxo-Wellcome, Inc. who makes Retrovir, has an <a href="../pa/zido.html">HIV Patient Assistance Program</a>: (800) 722-9294.</p>

<h3>Side effects</h3>

<p>Long-term AZT use is associated with loss of muscle. Other side effects can be anemia, white blood cell depression, lip, mouth and tongue sores, bone marrow damage, headaches, skin rash, itching, weakness, nervousness, dizziness, nausea, stomach pain, confusion, loss of speech or appetite, muscle aches, fever or sweating, sore throat or abnormal bruising or bleeding. </p>

<h3>Dosage</h3>

<p>AZT is prescribed to delay the progression of HIV disease. AZT may help reduce the number of infections in people who have already been diagnosed with AIDS. AZT has only been shown to increase survival when taken by people with an AIDS diagnosis. It has reduced the number of infections The lowest effective dose of AZT has not been determined, and the currently recommended dose is 300-600 mg per day. </p>

<h3>How long it may take to work</h3>

<p>As with other anti-HIV drugs, ongoing maintenance therapy is used. Maintenance treatment means you keep taking the drug or drugs to control an infection so that you don't become ill.</p>

<h3>Managing side effects</h3>

<p>Recent studies indicate that possible blood cell damage may be prevented or treated by taking vitamin E, <a href="eryt.html">erythropoeitin alpha</a> (EPO) or <a href="filg.html">G-CSF</a> with this drug. AZT is best taken on an empty stomach. If you have stomach irritation, AZT may be taken with food. The capsules can be broken open and mixed with food right before eating if you have trouble swallowing. Nutritionists recommend taking manganese and B vitamins with this drug. </p>

alt="">3TC (Epivir, lamivudine)</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of 3TC currently enrolling, as well as other treatments, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Drugs for treating HIV</A>. <i>See also <a href="../news.html#3TC">In the News</a>.</i></h5>

<HR align=center width=50% size=3 noshade>

<font size=-1>

<p>3TC, trade name Epivir (also known as lamivudine), is a new anti-HIV treatment in the same class of drugs as <a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a> and <a href="stav.html">d4T</a>. These drugs are called nucleoside analogs. The body breaks down these drugs into chemicals that stop HIV from infecting uninfected cells in the body, but it does not help cells that have already been infected with the virus. As people with AIDS lose T4 cells – one of the immune systems main defenses – they become more likely to get infections and illnesses.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that 3TC can raise T4-cell levels, and lower levels of HIV. More importantly, studies show that 3TC treatment may make AZT work better, even in people who have already taken AZT for a long time. 3TC has been approved by the government for use in combination with AZT in people with less than 500 T4 cells. The recommended dosage of 3TC is 150 mg twice a day.</p>

<p><b>Trial results</b><br>
A large European trial of 3TC enrolled 1,892 people with T4 cells between 25 and 250. Participants in this study were already being treated with AZT, or AZT with ddI, or AZT with ddC. People were randomly divided into three groups. One group added 3TC to their current treatment. The second group added 3TC and an experimental drug called loviride. The third group added a fake pill called a placebo. The study was stopped after one year because people receiving 3TC had a 54% reduction in disease progression and death. Everyone on the study has now been allowed to add 3TC to their treatment.</p>

<p>Several trials have studied the combination of AZT and 3TC and compared it to AZT taken alone. The combination of AZT and 3TC significantly increased T4 cells and reduced the amount of HIV in the bloodstream, known as the viral load. These effects have been sustained for up to two years in some participants. The information from four AZT/3TC studies was also looked at to see if the combination was improving the health of study participants. Researchers found that the combination of AZT and 3TC reduced the chance of disease progression or death by around 49%, or nearly half.</p>

<p>3TC is now being used in combination studies with a new class of anti-HIV drugs called <a href="protease.html">protease inhibitors</a>. A <a href="../trials/hiv.html#mrk-033">study</a> of the combination of the protease inhibitor <a href="indi.html">indinavir</a> (trade name Crixivan) with AZT and 3TC is ongoing. People in this study had an average of around 150 T4 cells, and had been taking AZT for an average of at least two years before they joined the trial. After 36 weeks, 21 of the 26 people taking the triple combination of indinavir, AZT and 3TC had so little virus in their blood that it could not be found using the standard <a href="viral.html">viral load test</a>. This test cannot find less than 500 copies of HIV in a milliliter of blood. The average increase in T4 cells after 36 weeks was 131 cells.</p>

<p>Studies have also shown that 3TC reduces the amount of hepatitis B virus to where it can’t be found anymore in all participants. Lasting results at the same dosage level were found in 6 of 22 patients over six months.</p>

<p><b>Side effects</b><br>
In studies, the side effects of headache, nausea and fatigue were all seen in more than a quarter of the people taking the combination of 3TC and AZT. Other side effects seen were nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea, neuropathy (burning pain in the hands or feet), low white blood cells and anemia (low red blood cells). These side effects are often seen with AZT taken alone. Some doctors suggest that people who cannot take AZT because of side effects consider combining 3TC with other anti-HIV drugs such as d4T. Early results from studies of 3TC and d4T suggest that it is an effective combination, especially if someone has been on AZT for a long time. In children, 3TC can cause a side effect called pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is a dangerous swelling of an organ in the body called the pancreas. Children taking 3TC should be carefully monitored for this side effect.</p>

<P><b>Current studies</b><br>
Studies are now enrolling of 3TC in combination with other anti-HIV drugs for <a href="../trials/hiv.html">adults</a> and <a href="../trials/children.html">children</a>. Call The Network at (800) 734-7104 for more information.</p>

<p><i>3TC has few side-effects, mainly nausea, vomiting and headaches, and rare cases of hair loss.  Its major problem has been that it doesn’t work well alone. 3TC can stop working so well a few weeks after treatment starts, because the virus becomes resistant to the drug. But lab tests have shown that when the virus becomes resistant to 3TC, it may no longer be resistant to AZT. Virus that is resistant to 3TC may also reproduce less well than normal virus.</i></p>

<title>Simple Facts Sheets: anabolic steroids</title>

<h1 align=center><img align=middle hspace=2 src="../gifs/pillshot.gif" alt="">anabolic steroids</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for wasting currently enrolling, as well as for other opportunistic infections, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/ois.html">Drugs for treating opportunistic infections</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 align=center width=50% noshade>

<font size=2><p>Steroids are an important class of biologic compounds in the body. The sex hormones are steroids and include testosterone, the primary anabolic steroid in humans. One of the functions of anabolic steroids is to help build muscle.</p>

<p>The way your body uses protein can be affected by HIV infection. Many organs such as the heart are made of muscle tissue and the body needs a steady source of protein in order to build muscle and function properly. Anabolic steroids can increase the body's ability to use protein to make muscle. Anabolic steroids help send important building blocks of proteins called amino acids back to the muscles. Amino acids are needed by muscles to grow.</p>

<p>Testosterone is an anabolic steroid produced in the testicles and adrenal glands. The function of testosterone is to build muscles and masculinize. Naturally occurring testosterone is rapidly removed from the body by the liver and doesn't circulate in the body long enough to be useful as a treatment. Oral synthetic forms of testosterone are cleared more slowly by the liver, but tend to have side effects toxic to the liver.</p> 

<p>Injectable testosterone formulations have longer half-lives than naturally occurring testosterone. A half-life means how long the treatment stays in the body. The  injectable forms are also less toxic to the liver than the oral formulations. If you are having significant weight loss, you may want to talk to your doctor about treatment with anabolic steroids. Anabolic steroids may be useful as part of an effective diet and exercise regimen to build and maintain weight. The doses used for maintenance of weight under the direction of a doctor are not high enough to cause many of the side effects associated with their use among athletes.</p>

<p>To maintain weight through the use of anabolic steroids, it's important to eat foods rich in amino acids and protein sources. A recommended amount of protein is one gram for every pound of ideal body weight. Consult with a nutritionist about getting adequate amounts of protein from food and nutrition supplements. Four meals a day may be better for you than three. If you are unable to eat due to side effects of medications and infections, a consultation with a nutritionist can help you figure out ways to get enough protein through nutrition supplements. The Network can refer you to a nutritionist experienced in working with people with HIV and AIDS. </p>

<p>If you are taking an anabolic steroid to increase and maintain your weight, your doctor should consider cycling you off the drug every 6-8 weeks as a safeguard against side effects. Continuous use of high doses of any anabolic steroid can cause a serious syndrome called peliosis hepatitis which can result in liver failure or stomach bleeding. If you have any history of diabetes or other liver problems, you should not attempt to use anabolic steroids. Use of testosterone is not recommended for women, and adequate study of testosterone treatment for women has not been done.</p>

<p>The FDA has granted orphan drug status to an anabolic steroid called oxandrolone (trade name Oxandrin) for use in treating HIV-related wasting. Oxandralone is a pill. This drug is not usually toxic to the liver, which can be a problem with other oral anabolic steroids. The drug also seems less likely to have a masculinizing effect on women than other anabolic steroids.</p>

<p>Oxandrolone is available by prescription for the treatment of weight loss. However, it must be obtained direct from the distributer, Quantum Express. The number to call is (800) 741-2698. Quantum Express can deal directly with your health insurance to help obtain reimbursement, and also has a compassionate access program for those that cannot afford to pay for the drug.</p>

<p>In one study of oxandrolone as a treatment for AIDS-related wasting, weight gain was seen in people taking 15 mg a day for 16 weeks. In people taking 5 mg a day, weight remained stable. People taking a placebo, or fake pill, experienced weight loss. </p>

<p>For more information about anabolic steroids for the treatment of HIV-related weight loss, contact PoWeR at (713) 526-5883. This non-profit organization is informational only, but can provide sample treatment protocols.</p>

<p><i>A significant side effect of some anabolic steroids is a tendency to produce an inflammation of the liver called hepatitis when taken orally. For older men, side effects can include rapid enlargement of the prostate, causing difficulty with urination and the possiblity of activating a previously undetected and inactive prostate cancer.</i></p></font>

<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff><font face="arial, helvetica" size=-1>

<h2 align=center><img src="../gifs/iv.gif" alt="[IV picture]" hspace=5 align=middle>cidofovir (Vistide, HPMPC)</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote>
<h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for CMV retinitis currently enrolling, as well as for other opportunistic infections, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/ois.html">Drugs for treating opportunistic infections</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<p>Cidofovir (trade name Vistide, formerly known as HPMPC) is a new treatment for CMV retinitis. <a href="cmv.html">CMV</a> is an infection caused by a herpesvirus called cytomegalovirus. When CMV infects the eyes, it's called CMV retinitis. If CMV retinitis isn't treated, it can cause blindness. CMV can also infect other parts of the body, but retinitis is the most common CMV infection in people with AIDS. Although there is no cure for CMV, treatments like cidofovir can delay progression and help prevent blindness. It is not yet known how well cidofovir can treat CMV in other parts of the body.</p>

<p>Cidofovir is given by intravenous infusion, directly into a vein in the arm. The infusion is given once a week for the first two weeks - this is called the induction treatment. The infusion is then given once every other week to keep the CMV infection under control. You do not need a catheter installed to take cidofovir. A catheter is a device that's permanently placed in your chest if you need to take an intravenous drug regularly.</p>

<p>In clinical trials, cidofovir has been shown to delay progression of CMV retinitis. The average time to any progression of retinitis or stopping of cidofovir treatment was 52 days in a study of people who had not received previous CMV treatment. In a study of people whose CMV retinitis was progressing on other treatments, time to further progression or stopping of cidofovir treatment was 35-49 days, depending on the dose used.</p>

<p>Cidofovir can be harmful to the kidneys. To try and prevent kidney damage, cidofovir is given with a lot of fluids. Probenecid, a drug that helps protect the kidneys, must also be given with cidofovir. Unfortunately, probenecid contains sulfa, a substance that can cause allergic reactions. Side effects caused by reactions to sulfa-containing drugs can include rash and fever.</p>

<p>If someone is taking cidofovir, doctors need to watch for early signs of kidney problems using blood and urine tests. Decreased urination, increased thirst, or light-headedness after standing up can also be early warning signs of kidney problems. If a person already has kidney problems, cidofovir may not be an appropriate treatment for them.</p>

<p>Cidofovir is also being studied in an intravitreal formulation. Intravitreal means the drug is given directly into the eye. The drug may work for longer and cause fewer side effects when given this way. Until studies are completed, the manufacturer recommends that the approved formulation NOT be used in this way due to the risk of hypotony, a shrinkage of the eye that causes blindness.</p>

<p>The other approved anti-CMV drugs are <a href="../access/drugs/ganc.html">ganciclovir</a> and <a href="../access/drugs/fosc.html">foscarnet</a>. Ganciclovir is also called Cytovene, and foscarnet is called Foscavir. Both drugs are usually given by daily intravenous infusion. Ganciclovir is now also available as a <a href="cytovene.html">pill</a>, and the pill can sometimes be used as a maintenance treatment. Ganciclovir is also available in an <a href="implants.html">implant</a> that is placed in the eye called Vitrasert.</p>

<p>Another CMV treatment called ISIS 2922 is currently in <a href="../trials/cmvret.html">clinical trials</a>. ISIS 2922 is given directly into the eye. A <a href="../trials/cmvret.html#2922">compassionate use program</a> can make ISIS 2922 available to people that are failing other treatments. Call the Network for a referral.</p>

<p><a name="alert">An alert</a> has been issued about cidofovir causing kidney failure. It is very important to follow the medical guidelines for using cidofovir to avoid this potentially fatal side effect. For copies of the alert and guidelines for medical providers call (800) 445-3235.</p>

<p><i>Gilead Sciences, the company that makes cidofovir, has set up a <a href="../access/pa/cido.html">patient assistance program</a> for people having difficulty accessing the drug. Call (800) 445-3235 for more information.</i></p>

<TITLE>Simple Facts Sheets: combination therapy</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">

<h2 align=center><img align=middle hspace=2 src="../gifs/pill.gif"

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>for more information about clinical trials for the treatmen of HIV currently enrolling, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Drugs for treating HIV</A></h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<p>The most commonly prescribed anti-HIV treatment has been the drug <a href="zido.html">AZT</a> (brand name Retrovir). Other anti-HIV drugs that work in a similar way to AZT are <a href="dida.html">ddI</a> (Videx), <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a> (Hivid), <a href="stav.html">d4T</a> (Zerit), and <a href="three.html">3TC</a> (Epivir). These drugs are known as nucleoside analogs. A newer class of anti-HIV drugs are <a href="protease.html">protease inhibitors</a>. The approved protease inhibitors are <a href="saquin.html">saquinavir</a> (Invirase), <a href="riton.html">ritonavir</a> (Norvir) and <a href="indi.html">indinavir</a> (Crixivan). Recently completed studies clearly show that combinations of these anti-HIV drugs are much more effective than AZT alone in preventing disease progression and death.</p>

<p>The first studies to show the benefits of combination therapy were called DELTA and ACTG 175. These studies compared combinations of AZT with ddI and AZT with ddC to AZT taken alone. Several thousand people took part in these studies. People taking the combinations survived longer and had less disease progression than those taking AZT alone.</p>

<p>Since these studies were done, protease inhibitors have become available. A new test for measuring how well anti-HIV drugs are working is also available. The test is called the <a href="viral.html">viral load test</a>, and measures the amount of HIV in the blood. Researchers are finding that the level of HIV in the blood is linked to a person's risk of getting sick. A study has shown that using drug treatments to lower the level of HIV can reduce the chances that a person will get sick.</p>

<p>These new discoveries are changing the way doctors think about HIV treatment. Combination anti-HIV treatment is now the standard of care for people with HIV. We still don’t have enough experience to know which anti-HIV drug combination works best, or for the longest time. What is known is that the stronger the anti-HIV effects of a combination therapy, the less likely it is that HIV will become resistant to the effects of the drugs. When HIV becomes resistant to a drug, that drug no longer works against the virus. This has led many doctors to use three drug combinations.</p>

<p>The decision about which combination of anti-HIV drugs may work best for an individual is usually based on several factors.</p>

<ul>
<li>Which combination has the best chance of reducing the amount of HIV in my body for the longest time?

<li>Which combination will best increase my T4 cell count or keep it stable and hopefully prevent disease progression?
 
<li>What are my options if this combination stops working?
 
<li>What are the possible side effects of the drug combination? How many pills will I need to take? What symptoms do I have now?
</ul>

<p>Each of these questions may be part of the decision making process.</p>

<p>The best time to start combination therapy is not yet known. The new viral load tests may be helpful, as studies have shown the risk of disease progression is higher when the viral load is above 10,000. Most trials of anti-HIV drugs have also found benefits to treatment when the T4 cell count has dropped below 500. Because medication to prevent an opportunistic infection called <a href="pcp.html">PCP</a> is needed when the T4 cell count goes below 200, anti-HIV treatment is usually considered before the T4 cell count gets this low.</p>

<p><a href="../trials/hiv.html">Studies</a> of different combination therapies are ongoing. Call the Network if you need a referral.</p>

<p><i>Combinations of protease inhibitors being studied for the treatment of HIV infection. A <a href="../trials/hiv.html#ampro">study of ritonavir and saquinavir</a> is ongoing, and a study of saquinavir and indinavir is planned. Until results of these studies are available it is not a good idea to try combining protease inhibitors, as they can interact in ways that might be extremely dangerous. Early results from the study of ritonavir and saquinavir are expected to be announced in July 1996.</i>

The body breaks down these drugs into chemicals that stop HIV from infecting uninfected cells in the body, but it does not help cells that have already been infected with the virus. As people with AIDS lose T4 cells - one of the immune systems main defenses - they become more likely to get infections and illnesses.</p>

<p><b>Trial results</b><br>
Early studies showed that ddI raises the level of T4 cells. A later study showed that, in people who'd never taken antiviral drugs to treat HIV, AZT was better than ddI at keeping people healthy and alive. In people who'd taken AZT for up to eight weeks, ddI was as good as AZT at keeping people alive and healthy. In people who'd taken AZT for more than sixteen weeks, ddI was better than AZT. </p>

<p>Recent studies have looked at ddI in <a href="combo.html">combination</a> with other anti-HIV drugs. Several large studies have found that the combination of AZT and ddI is better at keeping people healthy than AZT alone. One large study found that people who hadn't taken anti-HIV drugs before did better on ddI alone than AZT alone. If someone has already taken AZT, the combination of AZT and ddI has been shown to be more effective than AZT and ddC in delaying disease progression. <i>(See also <a href="../../natap/advise.html#ddi">NATAP's paper</a> on the FDA approval hearings.)</i></p>

<p>ddI usually comes in the form of a large, flavored tablet that can be chewed or dissolved in water, or in a powder that gets dissolved in water. A <a href="../news.html#ddi">new, smaller, mandarin-flavored tablet</a> has recently been approved. This new tablet is softer and dissolves in water faster than the old tablet. Because food can slow down the body's absorption of ddI, people should not eat for one hour before taking ddI, or for two hours after. Dosage ranges from 250 mg to 600 mg depending on body weight. Tablets are available in 25, 50 and 150 mg dosages. Generally, people are told to take two doses, one in the morning, and one in the evening.</p>

<p><b>Side effects</b><br>
The most common side effects reported are stomach pain, diarrhea and symptoms of pancreatitis. Pancreatitis can appear as a pain in the stomach area that goes through to your back. If pancreatitis isn't caught soon enough, it can be very serious. Careful monitoring of a specific blood enzyme called amylase can provide warning of pancreatitis.</p>

<p>Painful and persistent peripheral neuropathy at high doses, hepatitis, seizures, headaches, abnormal bone marrow function, and allergic reactions are less commonly reported side effects. </p>

<p>If you're taking ddI avoid alcohol, which can increase risk of pancreatitis. If peripheral neuropathy develops, which is not so frequent at a lower dose, you may want to ask your healthcare provider about stopping the drug for 4 to 6 weeks, and then restarting at a dose 35-50% less than what you were taking. </p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b><br>
ddI should not be taken in combination with <a href="../access/drugs/daps.html">dapsone</a> as this drug affects the absorption of ddI. Serious adverse reactions have been reported in people taking ddI at the same time as <a href="../access/drugs/rifa.html">rifabutin</a> and <a href="../access/drugs/clof.html">clofazimine</a> to treat MAC. If you are taking intravenous <a href="../access/drugs/pent.html">pentamidine</a> for PCP at the same time as ddI, there is an increased risk of pancreatitis.</p>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote>
<h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors currently enrolling, as well as other treatments, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Drugs for treating HIV</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<font size=-1><p>Delavirdine (trade name Rescriptor) is one of a class of experimental anti-HIV drugs called <a href="nnrtis.html">non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</a> (NNRTIs). Reverse transcriptase is a part of HIV required to infect cells in the body and make more virus. NNRTIs stop the reverse transcriptase from working properly, like the nucleoside analog drugs (<a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a>, <a href="stav.html">d4T</a> and <a href="three.html">3TC</a>).</p>

<p>Delavirdine has been shown in clinical trials to be well-absorbed by the body. Drug concentrations can be achieved in the blood that are 100 to 1,000 times the concentrations needed to inhibit HIV in the test tube. So far, the major side effect seen with delavirdine has been a rash, which develops in 20 percent to 25 percent of people taking the drug. This side effect can be reduced by starting treatment at lower doses of the drug and escalating to a full dose.</p>

<p>Clinical trials of delavirdine are ongoing. Early results from two trials have been presented. One study divided participants into four groups. One group took AZT alone. The second group took AZT and 600 mg of delavirdine a day. The third group took AZT and 900 mg of delavirdine a day. The fourth group took AZT and 1200 mg of delavirdine a day. People in this study had an average T4 cell count of just over 300.</p>

<p>After 40-60 weeks, people in the higher dose (900 and 1200 mg a day) delavirdine groups had T4 cell counts 35-70 cells higher than people taking AZT alone. People in these higher dose groups also had a 70% or greater drop in the amount of HIV in the blood, known as <a href="viral.html">viral load</a>, for at least 60 weeks. This study is ongoing, so how long this reduction in viral load will be sustained is not yet known.</p>

<p>The second study compared ddI taken alone to ddI and delavirdine at a dose of 1200 mg a day. The average T4 cell count of people in this study was 135. There were no large increases in T4 cell counts in this study, although they remained above or near the baseline for at least a year. However, as in the previous study, a reduction in viral load of around 70% was sustained for at least 60 weeks.</p>

<p>Scientists also looked at information from these studies in another way. They matched the information about viral load to the actual health of the study participants. This was done to see if measuring the amount of virus in the blood can be used to monitor the health of a person with HIV. The results showed that viral load was very strongly linked to a persons health.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: the following viral load information is based on the Upjohn/Pharmacia viral load test which gives results approximately five times higher than other viral load tests. As always, close consultation with your health care provider is important when trying to interpret and understand viral load test results.</p>

<p>People who began the studies with a viral load of less than 100,000 had only a 1% chance of experiencing any disease progression during the approximately 60 weeks for which information has been collected. People who started with a viral load of between 100,000 and 1,000,000 had a slightly higher chance of disease progression. People who started with a viral load of over 1,000,000 had a 24% chance of disease progression.</p>

<p>Treatment that reduced viral load was linked to improved health. Improved health was most noticeable in people who started the studies with a viral load of over 100,000. For these people, reduction in viral load of 70% or more for as little as 8 weeks reduced their chance of experiencing any disease progression by half during the study period of a little over a year. </p>

<p>Delavirdine is now available through an <a href="../trials/hiv.html#pu">expanded access program</a> for people with less than 300 T4 cells. Your doctor can call (800) 779-0070 for more information, or you can call the Network for a description of the program and other delavirdine clinical trials.</p>

<p><i>Delavirdine can interact with other medications you may be taking. It is processed by a pathway in the liver that is used to process many other drugs, including the protease inhibitors. The following have been shown to reduce the levels of delavirdine in the body: <a href="../access/drugs/rifa.html">rifabutin</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/rifam.html">rifampin</a>, ddI and antacids. Several other drugs may interact with delavirdine; a list will be provided to those enrolling in the expanded access program. Also, it is recommended that delavirdine be taken on an empty stomach. The current dosage is 400 mg, three times a day.</i></p>

<h2 align=center>DOXIL</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for KS currently enrolling, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/ks.html">Drugs for treating KS</A>.</h5>

<HR align=center width=50% size=3 noshade>

<font size=2><p>DOXIL is a new treatment for <a href="ks.html">Kaposi's sarcoma</a>, or KS. KS is a type of cancer that men with HIV may develop. It is rarely seen in women. Although KS mainly affects the skin, the mouth, and the lymph nodes, it can also involve the bowels and lungs. If it becomes severe, it may lead to swelling or breakdown of the skin. KS growths, called lesions or tumors, can show up in a wide range of colors, from pink to red-violet to brown to blue.</p>

<p>DOXIL is a liposomal drug. Liposomal drugs are standard chemotherapy drugs used to treat KS that are put inside microscopic bubbles of fat called liposomes. When the drugs are used this way, it is hoped they will have fewer side effects and be more effective. DOXIL is a liposomal version of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin. The drug is given intravenously, which means via a tube placed into your arm or chest. The procedure takes 30 minutes, and is done once every three weeks.</p>

<p>The current standard treatment for advanced KS is a combination of chemotherapy using the drugs Adriamycin, bleomycin and vincristine (ABV). These drugs can have severe side effects including damage to the heart, and also the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes white blood cells. When you lose white blood cells, you are more likely to get bacterial infections. Additional side effects, such as hair loss and nausea, may impact quality of life during treatment.</p>

<p>DOXIL has been approved for the treatment of advanced KS in people that have not responded to the standard treatment.  DOXIL is also recommended for people who can't take the standard treatments  for KS because of side effects.</p>

<p>In studies, around 60% of people saw some improvement in their KS when treated with DOXIL. This was called a partial response to treatment. Only 2.3% were defined as having a complete response. However, when KS is inside the body (sometimes called visceral KS) a partial response may enough to significantly improve your health.</p>

<p>Very few people in DOXIL studies had to stop treatment because of side effects. The main side effect is neutropenia, which is low white blood cells. Treatment with G-CSF, also known as Neupogen, can help lessen this side effect. Other side effects can be flushing, tight chest, difficulty breathing or swallowing and back pain. DOXIL can also cause heart problems, although this has not been seen as often as with standard chemotherapy.</p>

<p><i>Sequus Pharmaceuticals, the makers of DOXIL, have set up a <a href="../access/pa/doxil.html">patient assistance program</a>. Patient assistance programs help people having difficulty paying for a treatment. Call (800) 375-1658 for more information.</p></font>

<TITLE>Simple Facts Sheets: d4T</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff>

<h2 align=center><img align=middle hspace=2 src="../gifs/pill.gif" alt="">d4T 
(stavudine, Zerit)</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of d4T currently enrolling, as well as other treatments, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Drugs for treating HIV</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<font size=2><p>d4T is similar to the other anti-HIV drugs <a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a> and <a href="three.html">3TC</a>. These drugs are called nucleoside analogs. The body breaks down these drugs into chemicals that stop HIV from infecting uninfected cells in the body, but it does not help cells that have already been infected with the virus. As people with AIDS lose T4 cells - one of the immune systems main defenses - they become prone to a range of infections and illnesses. In clinical trials, people who took d4T had a modest increase in T4 cells. Some people also gained weight, and felt better.</p>

<p>The other names for d4T are stavudine and Zerit. d4T has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for people who are not able to take AZT. d4T may help people who have become resistant to AZT and other antiviral drugs. Resistance to the antiviral drug AZT may mean the virus will cause aggressive disease. d4T may also be a good treatment for people who are unable to take AZT because of side effects.</p>

<p>A study comparing continued AZT treatment to changing to d4T finished recently. People who changed to d4T developed fewer opportunistic infections and had higher T cell counts than those that stayed on AZT.</p>

<p>Early information from a study of d4T with ddI has also been released. People in this study had an average T4 cell count of 325. Around twelve people in this study have been followed for a year, and have had an average reduction in their viral load (the amount of HIV in the blood) of over 99% and T4 cell counts have increased by an average of 28 cells. This is a very small number of people, and more information is needed before it is known for certain that d4T and ddI is an effective combination therapy.</p>

<p>Over 10,000 people with AIDS and HIV have taken d4T through a special program sponsored by Bristol-Meyers/Squibb. This program compared a dose of 40mg twice daily to lower dose of 20mg twice daily. The trial concluded that both doses were safe but that the higher dose was slightly better at improving survival. Increased weight and fewer hospitalizations were also seen at the higher dose.</p>

<p>Studies are ongoing to see how well d4T works in people that haven't taken AZT before. There are also studies being done to see how well d4T works combined with other anti-HIV treatments, including the new protease inhibitors. The combination of d4T and 3TC is commonly being prescribed by doctors for people who cannot take AZT because of side effects. An <a href="../trials/hiv.html#306">ongoing study</a> will provide further information about this combination.</p>

<p>The most common side effect of d4T is peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy usually shows up as sharp burning pain sensations in the hands and/or legs. Early signs are a burning sensation or a numbness, like a deep pain that may come and go but always affects the same spot. Early symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are a tingling sensation in the fingertips, feet or legs.</p>

<p>Other rare side effects of d4T are pancreatitis, elevated liver function tests and bone marrow suppression. Symptoms of pancreatitis can be pains in the stomach area that go through to your back, and you should notify your doctor immediately if these symptoms occur. Your bloodwork should also be routinely checked for any signs of pancreatitis. Liver function should be closely monitored if you are taking d4T. Bone marrow suppression is monitored through your blood work. Bone marrow suppression does not occur as frequently with d4T as with AZT.</p>

<P><i>The more common and less severe side effects seen with AZT, ddI, ddC, and 3TC such as occasional headaches or nausea, are seen with d4T as well. With the start of any anti-viral treatment there may be temporary side effects such as headaches, hypertension, or a general sense of feeling ill. These side effects are likely to get better or even disappear over time.</p>

<h3>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3></center>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for HIV infection currently enrolling see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Drugs for treating HIV</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<font size=2><P>Hyperthermia is a treatment that raises the body's temperature. The process was used for many infections before antibiotics became available. Hyperthermia was once the standard treatment for syphilis before antibiotics. Today, a few treatment centers use hyperthermia for some cancers, usually in combination with chemotherapy.</p>

<p>Hyperthermia introduces heat into the body either from the outside, using hot air, ultrasound, or high temperature water, or invasively by heating the blood outside the body. Heating the blood outside the body is called extra-corporeal hyperthermia. Using extra-corporeal hypothermia, your blood can be heated to a higher temperature than would be possible with the other methods. The process of extra-corporeal hyperthermia is to remove your blood, heat it, and then return it to your body.</p>

<p>Though claims are made for extra-corporeal hyperthermia as a treatment for HIV infection, possible side effects are very dangerous. General anesthesia and mechanical ventilation are required during the treatment. Brain damage and death are possible. Your body has to be cushioned during treatment because of the possibility of bruising and denting in your skin due to breakdown in muscle cells. Drugs you are taking may not work as well after the treatment. </p>

<p>Dr. Kenneth Alonzo first presented his work on hyperthermia as a treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in people with AIDS in July 1990 at the VIth International Conference on AIDS in San Francisco. When the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAIDS) reviewed his results, it was found that one of the patients didn't even have HIV, but did have cat scratch fever. Dr. Alonzo continued his experiments at a clinic which he opened in Mexico City. At least one person died undergoing treatment there.</p>

<p>In April 1994, Senator Frank Lautenberg of NJ held a press conference in which he presented information on a person who he claimed seroconverted. Seroconversion means going from being HIV+ to being HIV-negative. It's possible the amount of virus in his blood was reduced by the treatment, but it's unlikely all the virus was eliminated from his body. Although the blood is the easiest way to access and measure virus, the blood contains only 2 percent of the virus in a person's body. It's unlikely, if not impossible, that removing blood from the body, heating it and then reinfusing it is going to be effective in reaching the other 98% of virus in lymph nodes or other tissue.</p>

<p>Results from an American study of hyperthermia have recently been released. This was the first carefully controlled study of the treatment. 30 people were in the study. Participants were divided into three groups. One group had their blood heated to 42 degrees for one hour. The second group had their blood heated to 40 degrees for one hour. These treatments were done twice, four days apart. A third group received no treatment. The average T4 cell count of people in the study was 120. Everyone was on anti-HIV drug therapy.</p>

<p>Six months after the treatments, participants T4 cell counts were not significantly different than before treatment. Measurements were also taken of HIV viral load in the blood. Three months after treatment there was no significant difference in viral load between the treated and untreated study participants. No significant improvements in the health of treated participants were seen. It is also known that one person in this study went into a coma after treatment, and died just over a month later.</p>

<p>These results seem to demonstrate that hyperthermia is not an effective treatment for HIV. However, another small study is planned to see if the treatment works any better in people with higher T4 counts.</p>

IL-2 helps the immune system produce cells whose job is to get rid of infected or cancerous cells. T4 cells need IL-2 to thrive. Without IL-2, activated T4 helper cells die.</p><p>Ten years ago, people with AIDS were given IL-2 in much higher doses than are being tested now. The results were disastrous. People became sick and died. Although most of the people with AIDS who took the drug were very sick in the first place, it appeared that the drug didn't help, and probably made things worse. Since that time, work on IL-2 has continued.</p><p>In previous studies of IL-2, a significant increase in T4 cells was seen for a short period and for as long as the drug was continued. The side effects were very toxic. Hopefully, the way the drug is now being tested will help avoid some of the side effects such as fevers, chills and an overall sick feeling. Scientists are fine tuning how IL-2 is given, including how much and when and for how long.</p><p>A recent study of IL-2 enrolled 60 people with T4 cells over 200. People were divided into two groups. The first group of 31 people received anti-HIV drugs (AZT, ddI, ddC or d4T, alone or in two-drug combinations) along with intravenous infusions of IL-2. The IL-2 infusions were given for five days every 2 months. The IL-2 dose was originally 18 million IU (International Units) a day, but by the end of the study most people were getting about 8 million IUs a day because of side effects.</p><p>People in the IL-2 group had an average of 428 T4 cells when they started the study. After 12 months the average T4 cell count of this group had increased to 916. One person in this group dropped out before receiving any IL-2, five people dropped out of the study due to side effects, and one person died of AIDS related complications.</p><p>The second group of 29 people in this study received anti-HIV drugs (<a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a> or <a href="stav.html">d4T</a>, alone or in two-drug combinations), but no IL-2. This group started the study with an average T4 cell count of 406. After 12 months, the average T4 cell count had gone down to 349.</p><p>There has been concern that IL-2 may increase the level of HIV in the body. In this study the levels of virus, known as viral load, stayed about the same in both groups.</p><p>In terms of side effects, in the IL-2 group 90% of people experienced fatigue or feeling unwell, 20% experienced headache, diarrhea, and inflammation of the mouth. Other side effects in the IL-2 group included abdominal pain, fever and sinus congestion. One person experienced toxicity to the heart.</p><p>It has been reported that two people that were originally in the IL-2 group have died, as compared to five people who were originally in the group not receiving IL-2. However, at least two of these five people received IL-2 after the first year of the study was completed, so there can not be said to be an important difference in number of deaths between the two groups.</p><p>T4 cells are one way of measuring the health of the immune system. But it is not always known if increased numbers of T4 cells caused by a treatment may actually help someone stay healthy or live longer. Because of this fact, a longer, larger trial of IL-2 is planned to see if the treatment will actually improve health and extend life.</p><p>Some people have begun on their own to inject themselves with IL-2, which is available by prescription for people with cancer. This is very dangerous. We don't recommend it. We strongly encourage the supervision of a trained medical professional. Until more is known about IL-2, how to best use the drug and what it actually does to the immune system, we encourage people who are considering using the drug to carefully weigh all the benefits and risks.</p><p>For more information on currently enrolling studies of IL-2, call the Network at (800) 734-7104.</p><p><i>Possible side effects of IL-2 include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, shortness of breath, low blood pressure and kidney and liver damage. </i></p><p align=center><FONT SIZE="1">The Simple Facts Project is a program of The Network.

<TITLE>Simple Facts Sheets: indinavir (Crixivan)</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff"><font face="helvetica, arial" size=-1>

<h2 align=center><img src="../gifs/pill.gif" align=middle>indinavir (Crixivan, MK-639)</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of protease inhibitors currently enrolling, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Treatments for HIV</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 align=center width=50% noshade>

<blockquote>

<p>Indinavir (trade name Crixivan, also known as MK-639) is one of a new group of anti-HIV drugs called <a href="protease.html">protease inhibitors</a>. These drugs work by blocking a part of HIV called protease. When protease is blocked, HIV makes copies of itself that can't infect new cells.</p>

<p><b>Trial results</b><br>
A study of the <a href="combo.html">combination</a> of indinavir, AZT and 3TC is on going. People in this study had been taking AZT for at least six months before they joined the trial. Participants were randomly assigned to take indinavir/AZT/3TC, indinavir alone, or AZT and 3TC. After 36 weeks, 21 of the 26 people taking the triple combination of indinavir, AZT and 3TC had so little virus in their blood that it could not be found using the standard <a href="viral.html">viral load test</a>. This test cannot find less than 500 copies of HIV in a milliliter of blood. 10 out of 24 people taking indinavir alone also had less than 500 copies of HIV in their blood samples. 1 out of 27 taking AZT and 3TC had the amount of HIV in their blood reduced below 500 copies.</p>

<p>Some people in this study have now been followed for 48 weeks. Six out of seven people on indinavir/AZT/3TC still have less virus in their blood than the viral load test can find. Five out of nine people on indinavir alone also have less virus in their blood than can be detected. None of the 8 people in the AZT/3TC group has undetectable virus.</p>

<p>The average increases in T4 cells after 36 weeks were 131 in the indinavir/AZT/3TC group, 121 for the people taking indinavir alone, and 14 for people taking AZT/3TC. Other studies of indinavir seem to confirm that it has a strong anti-HIV effect. A small study combining indinavir/AZT/ddI found that people had an average increase of 90 T cells after 24 weeks.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that these results are from only a few people, and it isn't known yet whether they will be confirmed by larger studies. It is not yet proven that the drug will help people live longer or stay healthy longer. However, recent studies have found that reducing the amount of virus in the blood can also reduce the risk of disease progression and death. This leads scientists to hope that drugs like indinavir will help people stay healthy and live longer.</p>

<p><b>Resistance</b><br>
HIV can become resistant to the effects of indinavir. Resistance has been seen in people in early studies where the indinavir dose was lower than the one now recommended. In these people, after 24 weeks on the study, levels of HIV in the blood returned to where they were before the study began. However, T4 cell increases averaging 80 to 100 were sustained for at least 52 weeks. This may mean that indinavir-resistant HIV is less harmful to the immune system than normal HIV, but it is too early to know for certain. Resistance seems to occur much more slowly at the dose now being used.</p>

<p><b>Taking the drug</b><br>
The recommended dosage of indinavir is 800 mg every 8 hours. The drug should be taken with water on an empty stomach, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. Alternatively, indinavir may be taken with other liquids such as skim milk, juice, coffee, or tea, or with a light meal, e.g., dry toast with jelly, juice, and coffee with skim milk and sugar; or corn flakes, skim milk and sugar. To avoid dehydration and kidney stones, it is recommended that you drink at least 1.5 liters (approximately 48 ounces) of liquids during the course of 24 hours.</p>

<p>To avoid developing resistance to the drug, it is very important not to skip doses. If you do miss a dose, don't double the following dose. Try and stick as close to the 8 hour schedule as possible, as this keeps a constant level of indinavir in your body, making it harder for HIV to become resistant to the effects of the drug.</p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b><br>
The antibiotic drug <a href="access/drugs/rifa.html">rifabutin</a> (Mycobutin) can be affected by indinavir. Researchers recommend that the dose of rifabutin be cut in half when taken with indinavir. The drug <a href="access/drugs/keto.html">ketoconazole</a> (Nizoral) can increase blood levels of indinavir. A dose reduction of indinavir to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered if you are taking ketoconazole.</p>

<p><b>Side effects</b><br>
The most common side effects of indinavir are kidney stones, which can cause pain in the side and back, and the temporary elevation of a
substance in the <a href="../../pwahg/info/liver.html">liver</a> called bilirubin. These have been seen in about 2-3% of people taking the drug in studies. Bilirubin usually returns to normal levels on its own.</p>

<p><b>Availability</b><br>
Until early 1997, indinavir will only be available via mail order from Stadtlanders Pharmacy. This is due to a limited supply. The number to call for more information is (800) 927-8888. See the <a href="../../pwahg/info/crix.html">PWA Health Group Info Sheet</a> about supply and availability.</p>

<TITLE>Simple Facts Sheets: liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome)</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff>

<h2 align=center><img src="../gifs/iv.gif" hspace=5 align=center>liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome)</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for KS currently enrolling, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/ks.html">Drugs for treating KS</A>.</h5>

<HR align=center width=50% size=3 noshade>

<font size=2><p>DaunoXome is a new treatment for advanced AIDS-related <a href="ks.html">Kaposi's sarcoma</a>, or KS. KS is a type of cancer that people with HIV may develop. KS is more commonly seen in men than in women. Although KS mainly affects the skin, the mouth, and the lymph nodes, it can also involve the bowels and lungs. If it becomes severe, it may lead to swelling or breakdown of the skin. KS growths, called lesions or tumors, can show up in a wide range of colors, from pink to red-violet to brown to blue.</p>

<p>DaunoXome is a liposomal drug. Liposomal drugs are standard chemotherapy drugs used to treat KS that are put inside microscopic bubbles of fat called liposomes. When the drugs are used this way, it is hoped they will have fewer side effects and be more effective. DaunoXome is a liposomal version of the anti-cancer drug daunorubicin. DaunoXome is given intravenously, which means via a tube placed into your arm or chest, once every two weeks.</p>

<p>The current standard treatment for advanced KS is a combination of chemotherapy using the drugs <a href="../access/drugs/doxo.html">Adriamycin</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/bleo.html">bleomycin</a> and <a href="../access/drugs/vinc.html">vincristine</a> (ABV). These drugs can have severe side effects including damage to the heart, and also the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes white blood cells. When you lose white blood cells, you are more likely to get bacterial infections. Additional side effects, such as hair loss and nausea, may impact quality of life during treatment.</p>

<p>DaunoXome has been approved as a first-line treatment for advanced KS. DaunoXome is also approved for people who can't take the standard treatments for KS because of side effects.</p>

<p>The largest study of DaunoXome enrolled 227 people. The study compared DaunoXome to the standard combination chemotherapy, ABV. Three people on DaunoXome and one on ABV had a complete response, defined as no detectable disease for at least four weeks. 26 people on DaunoXome and 30 on ABV had a partial response, which was a 50% or greater decrease in disease for at least four weeks. The majority of people in the study, 72 on DaunoXome and 64 on ABV, had stable disease.</p>

<p>The side effects of fatigue, neuropathy (pain in the hands and feet), hair loss, nausea and diarrhea were seen more often in people taking ABV than those taking DaunoXome. Only 13% of people on DaunoXome had neuropathy, compared to 41% of people on ABV. Hair loss occurred in 8% of people on DaunoXome compared to 36% of people on ABV. However, leukopenia and/or neutropenia (low levels of certain important white blood cells) was seen in over a third of people in both the DaunoXome and ABV groups. Forty-five people taking DaunoXome and twenty-nine people taking ABV developed a new opportunistic infection during the study.</p>

<p>There was a small indication that survival may have been slightly better on DaunoXome compared to ABV, although it was not considered a significant difference.</p>

<p>Other side effects of treatment with DaunoXome can be hot flushes, tightness in the chest, difficulty breathing or swallowing and back pain. These side effects usually occur during the first five minutes of the infusion, and can often be stopped if the infusion is interrupted and then started again at a slower rate. DaunoXome can also cause heart problems, although this is not as common as with standard chemotherapy. People taking DaunoXome should still have their heart function carefully monitored. The side effect of neutropenia can be reduced by treatment with <a href="../access/drugs/filg.html">G-CSF</a>, also known as Neupogen.</p>


<p><i>NeXtar Pharmaceuticals, the makers of DaunoXome, have set up a <a href="../access/pa/daun.html">patient assistance program</a>. Patient assistance programs help people having difficulty paying for a treatment. Call (800) 226-2056 for more information.</i></p>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff link="#00688b" vlink="#545454"><font face="arial, helvetica" size=-1>

<h2 align=center>nevirapine (Viramune)</H2>

<H3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for HIV currently enrolling see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Drugs for treating HIV</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<font size=-1><p>Nevirapine (trade name Viramune) is one of a class of drugs called <a href="nnrtis.html">non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)</a>. Like the the nucleoside analogs (AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T, 3TC), NNRTIs block HIV's infection of new cells. Reverse transcriptase is a part of HIV required to make new virus and infect more cells. NNRTIs stop the reverse transcriptase from working properly.</p>

<p>Nevirapine has been approved for use in combination with nucleoside analog anti-HIV drugs in people who are failing their current treatment. Nevirapine is not approved for use with the <a href="protease.html">protease inhibitor</a> anti-HIV drugs (saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir) as it is not yet known how these drugs may affect each other in the body. It is possible that taking nevirapine with protease inhibitors could be harmful to the <a href="../../pwahg/info/liver.html">liver</a>.</p>

<p><b>Trial results</b><br>
The largest study of nevirapine was done in people with less than 350 T4 cells. There were 398 people in the study. The average T4 cell count was 138. Everyone had taken AZT, ddI or ddC for at least six months before starting the study. People were divided randomly into two groups. One group took AZT and ddI. The second group took AZT, ddI and nevirapine.</p>

<p>After four weeks, the amount of virus in the blood was reduced by about 90% in people taking AZT, ddI and nevirapine. However, after 48 weeks both groups had less T4 cells than at the start of the study, but T4 cell counts were around 30 cells higher in the AZT/ddI/nevirapine group. The amount of virus in the blood, or viral load, was slightly lower in the AZT/ddI/nevirapine group. In terms of disease progression or survival, 17% of people on AZT/ddI/nevirapine had a progression of disease or died, compared to 14% in the AZT/ddI group. This difference was not statistically significant, which means it could have been due to chance. This study did not show a significant benefit from adding nevirapine to AZT and ddI therapy.</p>

<p>Another study that has been presented divided 151 participants into three groups. No one in this study had taken anti-HIV drugs before. One group took nevirapine with AZT and ddI. The second group took AZT with ddI. The third group took nevirapine with AZT. The average T4 cell count was 376. After 52 weeks the 51 people in the nevirapine/AZT/ddI group had an average of 140 more T4 cells than at the start of the study. The AZT/ddI group had 30 more T4 cells than at the start of the study. The nevirapine/AZT group had the same number of T4 cells as they had started with.</p>

<p>In this study, measurements of the amount of HIV in the blood are available after 28 weeks of the study. Both the AZT/ddI/nevirapine and AZT/ddI groups had a greater than 90% reduction in the amount of HIV in their blood after 28 weeks. It has been reported that about half the people in the triple combination group have viral loads lower than the test can detect. The nevirapine/AZT group had a large drop in the amount of HIV in their blood after four weeks, but were nearly back to where they had started after 28 weeks on the study.</p>

<p>This study shows that for people who have not taken anti-HIV drugs before, triple combinations of two nucleoside analog drugs and nevirapine can shut down HIV reproduction in the body very effectively.</p>

<p><b>Resistance</b><br>
HIV seems to get resistant to the effects of nevirapine very quickly unless the drug is used with two other nucleoside analogue drugs. If a person is resistant to nevirapine, they will likely be resistant to the other NNRTI that will soon be available, delavirdine. Information from two large clinical trials of delavirdine has been released, and is encouraging. The Network has a separate <a href="dela.html">Simple Fact Sheet</a> on this drug.</p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b><br>
Nevirapine is processed in the body by the liver, like many other drugs. It has the potential to interact with commonly used drugs such as <a href="../access/drugs/rifa.html">rifabutin</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/rifam.html">rifampin</a> and <a href="../access/drugs/keto.html">ketoconazole</a> and researchers advise that people be monitored closely for interactions if they are taking other drugs with nevirapine. In studies, taking nevirapine with the antifungal drug <a href="../access/drugs/fluc.html">fluconazole</a> (Diflucan) increased the chance of getting a rash. For updated information on drug interactions, there is a medical information contact at the manufacturer that can be reached by calling (800) 542-6257.</p>

<p><i><b>Side effects</b>: The major side effect of nevirapine is a rash, which happened to 22% of people in studies. 6% of people in studies had a severe rash. 6.7% of people had to stop taking nevirapine because of this problem. This problem can be reduced by starting treatment at 200 mg a day and escalating, or building up, to the higher dose of 400 mg a day. If nevirapine causes a severe rash and you have to stop treatment, the company that makes the drug recommends that you DO NOT try the drug again. Other side effects can be elevated liver function tests, fever and muscle soreness.</i></p>

<p>Boerhinger Ingelheim/Roxane, the manufacturers of nevirapine, have set up a <a href="../access/pa/nevi.html">patient assistance program</a> for people needing assistance accessing the drug. Call (800) 274-8651 for more information.</p>

<font size=2><P>One class of drugs that is being tested in <a href="combo.html">combination</a> with the nucleoside analog drugs (AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T and 3TC) are called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Sometimes, they are known as L-drugs, or BHAP compounds.</p>

<p>Like the nucleoside analogs, NNRTIs block HIV's infection of new cells. Reverse transcriptase is a part of HIV required to make new virus and infect more cells. NNRTIs stop the reverse transcriptase from working properly. </p>

<p>In early clinical trials of these kinds of drugs, it was found that HIV developed resistance in as few as two to seven weeks when the drugs were used alone. The drugs are now being tested in combination with other drugs in an effort to prevent resistance and limit side effects seen with the nucleoside analogs.</p>

<b><a href="nevi.html">Nevirapine</a></b> is an NNRTI that has been in a number of clinical trials. Doses of nevirapine as high as 600 mg a day have been taken, with the major side effects being fever, muscle soreness or a rash. Side effects were seen more frequently in participants taking higher doses. At 400 mg a day, more than half the trial participants taking that dose developed a rash. This problem is now managed by starting treatment at 200 mg a day and escalating, or building up, to the higher dose. Why dose escalation decreases the incidence of side effects is unknown.</p>

<p>When used alone, nevirapine was able to cause a rapid decrease in viral reproduction as measured by p24 antigen levels, but resistance to the drug emerged in as few as two weeks at the 200 mg a day dose. Recent studies show that the higher dose of 400mg delays HIV resistance to the drug. Current trials are testing nevirapine in combination with nucleoside analogs in adults, adolescents and children. There is also an <a href="../trials/hiv.html#bi-nv-ex">expanded access program</a> for people with less than 200 T4 cells. </p>

<p><b><a href="dela.html">Delavirdine</a></b> is an NNRTI that has been shown in clinical trials to be well-absorbed by the body. Drug concentrations can be achieved in the blood that are 100 to 1,000 times the concentrations needed to inhibit HIV. </p>

<p>Delavirdine appears in the test tube to be 50 to 100 times more potent than atevirdine, its parent, or first-discovered, compound. Delavirdine has blocked replication of 25 different HIV-1 strains, including some resistant to AZT and ddI. So far, the major side effect seen with delavirdine has been a rash, which develops in 20 percent to 25 percent of patients. As with nevirapine, this side effect can be reduced by starting treatment at lower doses of the drug and escalating to a full dose. </p>

<p>Two trials are studying delavirdine in combination with other treatments. The <a href="../trials/hiv.html#021">first trial</a> is enrolling participants who have taken AZT for less than six months and who have 300-500 T cells. Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will receive AZT and 3TC. The second group will receive AZT, 3TC and delavirdine.

The <a href="../trials/hiv.html#261">other trial</a> of delavirdine is for people who have had less than six months of AZT or ddI treatment and 100-500 T4 cells. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups. One group will take AZT, ddI and delavirdine. The second group will take delavirdine and AZT. The third group will take delavirdine and ddI. The fourth group will take AZT and ddI. There is also an <a href="../trials/hiv.html#pu">expanded access program</a> for delavirdine.</p>

<p><b>Loviride</b> is a third NNRTI.  In a double-blind-placebo-controlled German study, HIV+ patients with CD4 counts more than 400 were randomized to receive either loviride, placebo or R18893 (a compound similar to loviride). After 24 weeks of follow-up, the loviride group had the best CD4 responses with an average increase of approximately twenty percent over baseline. None of the known mutations conferring resistance to loviride were detected. Further trials are planned for this compound.</p>

<h5>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for CMV currently enrolling see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/ois.html">Drugs for treating opportunistic infections</A>.</h5>

<HR SIZE=3 WIDTH=50% ALIGN=CENTER noshade>

<font size=-1>
<P>CMV is an infection caused by a herpesvirus called cytomegalovirus. When CMV infects the eyes, it's called CMV retinitis. If CMV retinitis isn't treated, it can cause blindness. CMV can also infect other parts of the body, but retinitis is the most common CMV infection in people with AIDS. Although there is no cure for CMV, treatments can delay progression and help prevent blindness.</p>

<p><a href="../access/drugs/ganc.html">Ganciclovir</a> (trade name Cytovene), <a href="../access/drugs/fosc.html">foscarnet</a> (Foscavir) and <a href="cido.html">cidofovir</a> (Vistide) are the approved drugs for treating CMV retinitis. Ganciclovir and foscarnet are usually given by intravenous infusion, which means directly into a vein, twice daily. The infusions are given through a permanent catheter that's placed in your chest in order to have access to a large vein. Cidofovir is also given by infusion, but does not require a catheter because treatments are given once every other week. Once you have CMV disease you need ongoing treatment to prevent the CMV from progressing, and this is called maintenance treatment.</p>

<p>A pill form of ganciclovir was recently approved for maintenance treatment in some cases. You have to take 12 capsules a day. If you add 12 capsules to all the other drugs you may have to take, it's a lot. But while the 12 capsules may seem like a lot, the capsules are easier to take than IV ganciclovir.</p>

<p>Although IV infusion is still necessary for the first part of treatment, called induction therapy, oral ganciclovir can be used for maintenance. Oral ganciclovir is taken with food, either three times a day or six times a day.</p>

<p>Clinical trials comparing the capsule and IV forms of ganciclovir for maintenance treatment showed that progression of CMV retinitis in those taking the oral form was somewhat faster than those on IV infusion. The major side effects of the capsules, as with IV ganciclovir, are blood disorders called granulocytopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. The most common side effects experienced by those taking the capsules compared to IV infusion were diarrhea, fever, leukopenia, and nausea.</p>

<p>The pill form of ganciclovir has now been approved for the prevention of CMV disease in people at risk. People at risk for CMV are usually those with low T cells (usually under 50) who have been exposed to CMV in the past. The doctor can do a test to see if you have been exposed to CMV.</p>

<p>Oral ganciclovir was approved for CMV prevention because the results of one study showed that prophylaxis can delay the onset of CMV disease in people with low T4 cell counts. Prophylaxis is when a drug is taken to prevent active disease. Taking the capsules for prevention in this study seemed to reduce active CMV disease by about half. Because of the side effects, those taking the ganciclovir capsules had to take <a href="../access/drugs/filg.html">G-CSF</a> and <a href="../access/drugs/eryt.html">erythropoietin</a>, which stimulate growth of new blood cells, more often than study participants who got placebo.</p>

<p>Another CMV prevention study was very recently completed by the government-sponsored Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA). This results of this study did not support the use of oral ganciclovir for prevention of CMV disease. This study has been criticized for not giving participants regular check ups with an opthamologist (eye doctor). Further studies of oral ganciclovir for CMV prevention are planned to try and work out who can benefit from preventive therapy the most.</p>

<p>Other studies for <a href="../trials/cmvret.html">treatment of CMV</a> are ongoing. A study of oral versus IV ganciclovir for the treatment of <a href="../trials/colitis.html">CMV colitis</a> is enrolling. CMV colitis is CMV infection in the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<p>A <a href="../trials/cmvret.html#2304">study comparing different treatments</a> for CMV retinitis is also enrolling. Participants will be treated with IV ganciclovir, an eye implant with oral ganciclovir, or an eye implant alone. To participate, you must only have CMV retinitis in one eye. The implant is also available from the drug company through a <a href="../access/pa/gan-i.html">patient assistance program</a> if you are unable to take other treatments. Call The Network for more information.</p>

<p><i>The decision whether to take oral ganciclovir for prevention of CMV is a difficult one. You should discuss your risk for CMV with your doctor. There is a possiblity that if you develop CMV while taking oral ganciclovir the CMV will be harder to treat because of resistance. The company that makes the drug says that after 10 months of treatment only 1 percent of people became resistant to ganciclovir. It is known that one person on the CMV prevention study developed CMV disease that could not be treated with ganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir.</p>

<font size=2><P>Immunoglobulins (Ig) are antibodies that the body makes 
in response to infection. When the immune system is damaged, levels of immunoglobulins can be lower than what your body needs to fight infection. Concentrated intravenous immunoglobulins are used to treat children whose immune systems aren't working properly, and are being developed for other diseases as well.</P>

<P>Passive hyperimmune therapy (PHT) uses plasma from blood donors who are HIV+ but don't have any symptoms and are apparently controlling the virus well. This plasma is sterilized to avoid transmitting any new virus, then is infused into persons with AIDS. The plasma contains antibodies, and perhaps other substances, which may be helpful to recipients who have lost the ability to produce them. This approach to treatment has been used successfully in a number of other diseases.</P>

<P>The treatment involves giving a monthly infusion of blood plasma taken from people infected with HIV, but still healthy, to those who have developed clinical symptoms of the disease. The treatment depends on the willingness of healthy HIV+ people to make regular plasma donations for the benefit of others.</P>

<P>When given to people with AIDS once or twice a month, the treatment appears to significantly reduce the symptoms of AIDS and of opportunistic infections. While PHT seems to be a relatively safe form of AIDS treatment, long-term clinical benefits have not been demonstrated. In fact, there are some serious rebound effects that occur in some people who discontinue therapy, including an increased rate of opportunistic infections, wasting, and neurological deterioration. In addition, therapy is expensive and labor-intensive. PHT cannot prevent cell-to-cell spread of the virus, and may be ineffective against the multiple strains of the virus commonly found in people with AIDS.</P>

<P>Results of one study found benefits only in the recipients with baseline T4 cell counts between 50 and 200. There were no significant differences between the groups in opportunistic infections. This is different from the results of a French study, which found three times as many AIDS-related illnesses in the placebo group.</P>

<P>The pharmaceutical company Verigen Inc., presented data at the 10th International Conference on AIDS in Yokohama indicating some success in the testing of Verigen's intravenously formulated immunoglobulin G (IgG) treatment called PASSHIV-1. The evidence shows that this therapy is not a cure but is well tolerated during repeated administration and could have important clinical, antiviral, and immunological effects. All of the participants in the study have shown improvement when on the drug for two or three months in at least one clinical symptom, with no adverse clinical signs linked with retreatment. T4 cell counts remained largely unchanged over a three- to six-month period, and participants with p24 antigen demonstrated an immediate clearance over a two- to three-month period. p24 antigen levels are a measurement used to determine how much HIV virus is present in the blood.</P>

<P>The pharmaceutical company HemaCare submitted a new Investigation New Drug application (NDA) for its treatment Immupath to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July, 1994. The new studies will monitor plasma donors, HIV+ participants with T4 counts of 50-200, and HIV+ participants with T4 counts of 200-400. Immupath is an IV immune globulin (IVIG) antibody concentrate. Immupath has received orphan drug status.</P>

<P><i>All available information indicates that donation of plasma is not harmful to persons with HIV. Some data suggests that the donations may be helpful. With the exception of mild fevers, no major toxicities or adverse side effects have been documented in either the donors or the recipients. PHT can be very expensive, costing up to $300 per treatment.</i></P></font>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote>
<h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of protease inhibitors currently enrolling, as well as other treatments, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Drugs for treating HIV</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<p>Protease inhibitors are a new class of anti-HIV drugs. They work by blocking a part of HIV called protease. When protease is blocked, HIV makes copies of itself that can't infect new cells. So far, protease inhibitors appear to be less toxic and have fewer side effects than the other approved nucleoside analogs anti-HIV drugs (<a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a>, <a href="stav.html">d4T</a> and <a href="three.html">3TC</a>).</p>

<p>Studies have shown that protease inhibitors can reduce the amount of <a href="viral.html">virus in the blood</a> and increase T4 cell counts. In some cases these drugs have improved T4 cell counts even when they were very low or zero. Two recent studies have shown that protease inhibitors can help people live longer and get fewer opportunistic infections.</p>

<p>Studies have also shown that these effects can wear off over time. This happens because HlV makes more of itself all the time, and each new HIV virus that gets made may be slightly different than the one it made before. The new protease that the virus has made may not react at all to a drug that worked for the older type of protease. This is what scientists call <a href="../../natap/resist.html">resistance</a>.</p>

<p>At the current time, it is thought to be very important to try and stop HIV from becoming resistant to the effects of protease inhibitors. If the virus becomes resistant to one protease inhibitor, it might make it resistant to the effects of some other protease inhibitors. This could limit your treatment options.</p>

<p>To try and delay or prevent resistance, it's important to stick to the correct dose and schedule for taking a protease inhibitor. Make sure to find out how the protease inhibitor should be taken, e.g., on an empty or full stomach. Also find out about side effects, and whether there are things you can do to help manage them. The Network has separate Simple Fact Sheets on each of the approved protease inhibitors, <a href="saquin.html">saquinavir</a> (trade name Invirase), <a href="riton.html">ritonavir</a> (Norvir) and <a href="indi.html">indinavir</a> (Crixivan).</p>

<p>Early results of studies of protease inhibitors in combination with other anti-HIV drugs such as AZT and 3TC have shown large reductions in the amount of HIV in the blood. This type of combination therapy seems to help the drugs work for longer, and makes resistance less of a problem. Due to this fact, it is recommended that protease inhibitors be taken in combination with at least one other nucleoside analog anti-HIV drug. If possible, two other nucleoside anti-HIV drugs should be used with the protease inhibitor. This is called "triple combination therapy".</p>

<p>Combinations of protease inhibitors are now being studied for the treatment of HIV infection. A study of <a href="../trials/hiv.html#ampro">ritonavir and saquinavir</a> is ongoing, and a
study of saquinavir and indinavir is planned. Data from just six weeks of the saquinavir and ritonavir study has been presented. Doses studied so far have been 400 mg of saquinavir twice daily with ritonavir at either 400 mg twice daily, or the standard ritonavir dose of 600 mg twice daily. The combination seems safe so far, but researchers recommend waiting for further results before trying combinations of protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>Newer protease inhibitors are also being tested in <a href="../trials/hiv.html">clinical trials</a>. AG-1343 (<a href="../news.html#agouron">Viracept</a>) is a protease inhibitor made by a company called Agouron. New studies of this drug have begun recently. For information on where clinical trials of protease inhibitors are enrolling call The Network, (800)734-7104.</p>

<p><i>Protease inhibitors can effect the absorption of other drugs by the body. These are called drug interactions. Your health care provider should go over any potential drug interactions with you when starting a protease inhibitor. It may be necessary to change or alter the dose of certain medications to make sure that the protease inhibitor can work properly.</i></p>

<h2 align=center><img align=middle hspace=2

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote>
<h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of protease inhibitors currently enrolling, as well as other treatments, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Drugs for treating HIV</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<p>Ritonavir (trade name Norvir, also known as ABT-538) is one of a new group of anti-HIV drugs called <a href="protease.html">protease inhibitors</a>. These drugs work by blocking a part of HIV called protease. When protease is blocked, HIV makes copies of itself that can't infect new cells.</p>

<p><b>Trial results</b><br>
In a study in people with less than 100 T4 cells, ritonavir was found to help people live longer, and delay progression of disease. There were 1090 people in this study. The average T4 cell count was around 30. People were allowed to take any approved anti-HIV drugs while on the study. One group of people added ritonavir to the medications they were taking, the second group got a placebo or dummy pill.</p>

<p>After an average of six months of follow-up, 46 people taking the placebo had died compared to 26 people taking ritonavir. This means that for people taking ritonavir, the risk of death was greatly reduced - almost halved - compared to people taking the placebo.</p>

<p>The researchers also looked at the study results after just one month. At this point in time, 149 people taking the placebo had experienced a new opportunistic infection or died, compared to 69 people taking ritonavir. This seems to show that the drug can have an effect very soon after someone starts taking it.</p>

<p>Other studies of ritonavir in combination with other anti-HIV drugs are ongoing. A French study of ritonavir in combination with AZT and ddC enrolled 32 people. No-one had taken anti-HIV drugs before. The median T4 cell count was 156. After six months, 21 people were still in the study, 11 had dropped out because of side effects. The median T4 cell count had gone up to 303 after six months. The amount of virus in the blood had gone down from an average of 69,780 copies to 892.</p>

<p><b>Side effects</b><br>
The major side effects seen in ritonavir studies were nausea, vomiting, weakness and diarrhea. Other side effects that have been associated with the drug are numbing sensations around the mouth and elevated <a href="../../pwahg/info/liver.html">liver enzymes</a>.</p>

<p>Now that the drug is approved, people are reporting that these side effects may be very common and more severe than had been thought. This has led Abbott to recommend building up the dose of ritonavir slowly over a few days when first starting the drug. People can start at 300 mg twice a day, and then move on to 400 mg twice a day after a few days, carrying on until you reach the recommended dose of 600 mg twice a day. (See Abbott's <a href="abbott.html">Letter to Doctors</a>.)</p>

<p>It is very important that you take no longer than 14 days to build up the dose, as this could help HIV get resistant to the effects of the drug. If you can't take the full dose, the lowest dose that can be used is 500 mg twice a day, and this must be in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. (See <a href="../../pwahg/info/norvir.html">Norvir dosing up schedule</a>)</p>

<p>The drug should also be taken with a full high-protein, high-fat meal if possible. Anecdotal reports also suggest that taking ritonavir right after a meal with yogurt may help reduce side effects. If side effects continue and you cannot tolerate the drug, it may be an idea to consider another protease inhibitor such as <a href="indi.html">indinavir (Crixivan)</a> or <a href="saquin.html">saquinavir (Invirase)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b><br>
Ritonavir can effect the way other drugs are absorbed by the body. There is a long list of drugs that may be affected on the package insert that comes with ritonavir. It is very important that anyone about to start taking ritonavir goes over this list thoroughly with their healthcare provider. Some of the potential drug interactions are potentially life-threatening. If you need help working out which drugs are on the interaction list (some drugs have several different names) call The Network. (See <a href="../../natap/norvir.html">table of drug interactions</a>. View <a href="../../natap/norlist.html">list format</a> if your browser can't read tables.)</p>

<p>Not all protease inhibitors interact with as many other drugs. You may also be able to switch a problem drug so that you can take ritonavir.</p>

<p><b>Availability</b><br>
Ritonavir is now <a href="../news.html#ritonavir">approved</a> for the treatment of HIV disease and AIDS in adults. A study of ritonavir for <a href="../trials/children.html#riton">children</a> is enrolling, call the Network for a referral.</p>

<p><i>These are the drugs that should <b>NOT</b> be co-administered with ritonavir: amiodarone, astemizole, bepridil, bupropion, cisapride, clozapine, encainide, flecainide, meperidine, piroxicam, propafenone, propoxyphene, quinidine, rifabutin and terfenadine. The same applies to these sedatives and hypnotics: alprazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, midazolam, triazolam and zolpidem. Abbott has set up a special information line for people needing more information on prescribing ritonavir - the number to call is (800) 441-4987.</i></p>

<p>Abbott Laboratories, the makers of ritonavir, have set up a <a href="../access/pa/indi.html">patient assistance program</a> for people having difficulty paying for the drug. Call (800) 659-9050 for more information.</p>

<p>ABBOTT<br>
Pharmaceutical Products Division<br>
Abbott Laboratories<br>
200 Abbott Park Road<br>
Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-3537</p>

<P>April 5, 1996</p>

<p>Dear Health Care Provider:</p>

<p>I am writing to provide you with information about Norvir (ritonavir), Abbott's new protease inhibitor.</p>

<p>The recommended dosage of Norvir is 600 mg orally bid. It is recommended that Norvir be taken with meals if possible. Norvir blood levels are at their highest during the first week following initiation of therapy, gradually declining to steady state. These initially high levels may cause nausea. Gradually increasing the dose of Norvir over 5 days may provide some relief from nausea while maintaining therapeutic concentrations. You may wish to start Norvir using the following recommended titration schedule:</p> 

<p>Day 1: 300 mg bid <br>
Days 2 and 3: 400 mg bid <br>
Day 4: 500 mg bid <br>
Thereafter 600 mg bid</p>

<p>In addition, patients initiating combination regimens with Norvir and nucleosides may improve gastrointestinal tolerance by initiating Norvir alone and subsequently adding nucleosides before completing two weeks of Norvir monotherapy.</p>

<p>Norvir is indicated in combination with nucleoside analogs or as monotherapy for the treatment of HIV-infection when therapy is warranted. For patients with advanced HIV disease, this indication is based on the results from a study that showed a reduction in both mortality and AIDS-defining clinical events for patients who received Norvir. Median duration of follow-up in this study was 6 months. The clinical benefit from Norvir therapy for longer periods of treatment is unknown.</p>

<p>For patients with less advanced disease, this indication is based on changes in surrogate markers in studies evaluating patients who received Norvir alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents.</p>

<p>Co-administration of Norvir with certain nonsedating antihistamines, sedative hypnotics or antiarrhythmics may result in potentially serious and/or life-threatening adverse events due to possible effects of Norvir on the hepatic metabolism of certain drugs. See Boxed Warning and the Contraindications section of the Norvir Product Labeling. Enclosed, for your information is a copy of the Patient Drug Interaction Pocket Card that is available for distribution to patients at pharmacies. Please ask your patients to request this card when they receive Norvir from the pharmacist.</p>

<p>Norvir can produce large increases in plasma concentrations of certain highly metabolized drugs. Because of this, large dose reductions (greather than 50%), increased therapeutic drug concentration monitoring, and/or increased monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when drugs extensively metabolized are used concomitantly with Norvir. Agents which increase CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of Norvir, resulting in decreased Norvir plasma concentrations. For additional information, refer to the enclosed Health Care Profession Drug Interaction Card.</p>

<p>Norvir had a favorable safety profile in clinical trials. The most common adverse event were nausea (23% to 26%), diarrhea (13% to 18%), vomiting (13% to 15%), asthenia (9% to 14%), taste perversion (5% to 10%), anorexia (1% to 6%), circumoral paresthesia (3% to 6%), peripheral paresthesia (5% to 6%) and abdominal pain (3% to 7%).</p>

<p>Ask your Abbott HIV Specialist or Medical Center Representative for a copy of our Dosing Information Brochure, our Dosing Guide For Patients, and our Patient Drug Interaction Pocket Card, or call 1-800-441-4987. to support your efforts, we will continue to provide you with new and important information about Norvir on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<TITLE>Simple Facts Sheets: saquinavir</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">

<h2 align=center><img src="../gifs/pill.gif" align=middle>saquinavir (Invirase)</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of protease inhibitors currently enrolling, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Treatments for HIV</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 align=center width=50% noshade>

<font size=-1><p>Saquinavir (trade name Invirase) was the first <a href="protease.html">protease inhibitor</a> to be approved for the treatment of HIV infection. Protease inhibitors are a new class of anti-HIV drugs. They work by blocking a part of HIV called protease. When protease is blocked, HIV makes copies of itself that can't infect new cells. Saquinavir has been approved for use by people with under 300 T4 cells, in combination with one or more of the approved nucleoside analog drugs (AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T and 3TC). The current recommended dosage is 600 mg, three times a day.</p>

<p><b>Trial results</b><br>
In the largest clinical trial of saquinavir, the combinations tested were saquinavir/AZT, saquinavir/AZT/ddC, and AZT/ddC. After 48 weeks of treatment, people taking saquinavir/AZT/ddC had an average increase of 111 T4 cells. People taking saquinavir/AZT had an average increase of 74 T4 cells. People taking AZT and ddC had an average increase of 72 T4 cells.</p>

<p>A recent study compared the combination of saquinavir and <a href="zalc.html">ddC</a> (trade name HIVID) to saquinavir or ddC taken alone. The average T4 cell count of people in the study was 160-180. This study found that the combination reduced the death rate by two thirds - there were 28 deaths on ddC, 34 on saquinavir and 9 in the combination saquinavir/ddC group. <i>(See also <a href="../news.html#saqu">In the News</a>)</i></p>

<p><b>Resistance</b><br>
Studies have shown that HIV can become resistant to the effects of saquinavir. Resistance occurs because HlV makes more of itself all the time, and each new HIV virus that gets made can be slightly different. The type of protease that the HIV virus creates may be slightly different than the one it made before. The new protease that the virus has made may not be affected by saquinavir.</p>

<p>There are two changes, called mutations, in HIV protease that can make the virus resistant to saquinavir. In the largest study done so far, a little less than half the participants had HIV with one of these resistance mutations after a year of taking saquinavir. One of the mutations may also make it slightly easier for HIV to resist the effects of some other protease inhibitors, but this is not known for certain. This information comes from studies done in the test tube. Only further clinical trials in people can answer this question.</p>

<p><b>Absorption</b><br>
Saquinavir, in the current formulation, is not very well absorbed by the body. A small study done in California showed that the drug could have more anti-HIV effect when taken in higher doses. However, the doses used in this study would be very expensive. A <a href="../trials/hiv.html#14182">new version</a> of the drug is being tested that will hopefully be better absorbed. This new version of saquinavir is expected to replace the current pill when the testing is completed.</p>

<p>Studies have looked at ways to help the body better absorb saquinavir. Taking the drug after a full meal is strongly recommended. A small study found that ordinary reconstituted frozen grapefruit juice could help increase the levels of saquinavir in the body. People in the study drank a small (150ml) glass of the grapefruit juice with their saquinavir, followed by another glass an hour later. Drug levels were increased by about 50 percent. When people made the grapefruit juice stronger by mixing it with half the amount of water, the levels of saquinavir in their bodies doubled.</p>

<p>Using this method to try and increase the absorption of saquinavir may cause problems. The grapefruit juice may affect other drugs you are taking, and this could be dangerous. The acidity of grapefruit juice may also irritate the stomach. If you are thinking of using grapefruit juice to boost the levels of saquinavir in your body, talk about it with your healthcare provider.</p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b><br>
The antibiotics <a href="../access/drugs/rifam.html">rifampin</a> and <a href="../access/drugs/rifa.html">rifabutin</a> (Mycobutin) can greatly reduce the amount of saquinavir in the body. Researchers recommend that alternatives to these drugs are used if someone needs to take saquinavir. Theanti-fungal drug <a href="../access/drugs/keto.html">ketoconazole</a> slightly increases the amount of saquinavir in the body.

<p><b>Side effects</b><br>
Compared to nucleoside analog drugs, saquinavir seems to have few side effects. In studies, the most common side effects, occurring in very few people, were diarrhea, stomach discomfort and nausea.</p>

<p><i>Hoffman-La Roche, the company that makes saquinavir, has set up an <a href="../access/pa/saqu.html">assistance program</a> for people that need help getting the drug. The number to call is (800) 282-7780. The hours are Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM EST.</p>

<p>Studies are ongoing of the <a href="../trials/hiv.html#14182">new version</a> of saquinavir. Call The Network if you would like more information about these studies.</i></p></font>

<TITLE>Simple Facts Sheets: thalidomide</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff>

<h2 align=center><img align=middle hsapce=5 src="../gifs/pill.gif" alt="">thalidomide</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for HIV and opportunistic infections currently enrolling see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Drugs for treating HIV</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<font size=2><p>Thalidomide was banned in the early 1960s after it was found to cause deformed limbs in the children of women who took it early in pregnancy. The drug is now being investigated for use in treating AIDS, tuberculosis, and other illnesses. Researchers have found that thalidomide can inhibit the growth of HIV in test tubes.</p>

<p>Thalidomide works in lab experiments against HIV by suppressing a natural substance produced in the body. The substance is called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), also known as cachectin. TNF is released by white cells during infection and helps fight invading organisms. In some people with HIV infection, the production of TNF is high. High TNF levels are associated with more rapid progression to AIDS and with the development of HIV related central nervous system disease. Excessive production of TNF over a period of time may lead to weight loss and/or interfere with the ability of the immune system to deal with infections.</p>

<p>In a small trial, treatment with thalidomide was found to help with severe weight loss in people with AIDS. Researchers concluded that thalidomide had a beneficial effect on the symptoms of wasting syndrome but did not improve T4 cell counts or reduce HIV replication in these patients.</p>

<p>Trials have also shown that thalidomide can treat mouth ulcers very effectively in people with HIV.</p>

<p>The drug company that makes thalidomide is Celgene. Their brand is called Synovir. Celgene is sponsoring an ongoing Phase II trial using a placebo and two dose levels of Synovir. The trial will study how well thalidomide helps promote weight gain. In addition, a range of viral and immunologic markers will be evaluated to see whether or not Synovir affects HIV and immune system function. Participants will be divided into three groups. One group will take thalidomide at 100 mg daily. The second group will take thalidomide at 200 mg daily. The third group will take placebo. Thalidomide is a pill. Neither the participant nor the doctor will know which treatment is being given. To participate in this trial, you must be HIV+, 18 years or older, postmenopausal if female, and have weight loss, fevers or night sweats. If your T4 cell count is under 500, you must be on stable dose of AZT or ddI for at least a month before study entry. Good results have been reported by participants in the trial, particularly in controlling wasting and improving weight and muscle.</p>

<p>The dose used by some people living with AIDS in the USA is 100 to 300 mg/day and it is suggested to take the drug in late afternoon or night.</p>

<p>For people that cannot enter this trial, Celgene has started an expanded access program that can be reached at (800) 896-6766. 

<p>Thalidomide may also help treat TB and another bacterial infection, MAC. Studies are starting to investigate these uses. If you are interested in participating in the trials described here, call the Network for further information. Thalidomide can also be obtained directly from The PWA Health Group in New York. See their extensive <a href="../../pwahg/thal.html">information sheet</a>.</p>

<P><I>Thalidomide, which was developed in the 1950s to prevent nausea during pregnancy but was found to produce fetal limb abnormalities, has been found to inhibit replication of the AIDS virus and to heal canker sores in patients with AIDS and other conditions. Thalidomide is used for treatment some symptoms of Hansen's disease, or leprosy.</I></P></font>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote>
<h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials for anti-HIV treatments currently enrolling, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Drugs for treating HIV</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<font size=-1><p>ddC, trade name Hivid (also known as zalcitabine), is a an anti-HIV treatment in the same class of drugs as <a href="zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="stav.html">d4T</a> and <a href="three.html">3TC</a>. These drugs are called nucleoside analogs. The body breaks down these drugs into chemicals that stop HIV from infecting uninfected cells in the body, but it does not help cells that have already been infected with the virus. As people with AIDS lose T4 cells - one of the immune systems main defenses - they become more likely to get infections and illnesses.</p>

<p>As a single drug, ddC is less effective than AZT in delaying illness and death in people who've never taken antiviral treatment for HIV infection. In people who'd already taken AZT for a long time, ddC was about as effective as ddI in delaying illness and death.</p>

<p>Until recently, ddC was mostly used in <a href="combo.html">combination</a> with AZT after a person had begun to show signs of immune-system damage after taking AZT for a long time. However, several large studies have now shown that it is better to start anti-HIV treatment using a combination of drugs. In these studies, combinations of AZT with ddI and AZT with ddC were equally good at helping people stay healthy if they had not taken any treatment before. For people who had taken AZT already, the combination of AZT with ddI was better than AZT/ddC. </p>

<p>Adults take 2.25 mg of ddC per day divided into three doses. It is important to divide up doses and space them out evenly over the day in order to maintain adequate levels of ddC in the blood. </p>

<P><b>Side effects</b><br>
ddC rarely causes the anemia or suppression of white blood cells that are the major problem with AZT. Side effects of ddC can be skin eruptions, canker sores, general inflammation of the mouth, nausea, pancreatitis and fever. Pancreatitis can appear as a pain in the stomach area that goes through to your back. </p>

<p>A serious side effect of ddC is an inflammation of the nerves called peripheral neuropathy. The symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are burning or numbing in the hands or, most often, in the feet. The symptoms may start slowly. Some people develop only mild symptoms while others have to contend with serious pain that makes walking difficult. After people stop taking ddC, their peripheral neuropathy will usually go away, but it can take weeks and even months. Also, peripheral neuropathy may continue to get worse for a little while after ddC treatment is stopped.</p>

<p>Antidepressants such as Elavil seem to have effect in treating peripheral neuropathy. Some people also find <a href="../altx.html">acupuncture</a> helpful. Local treatment with a salve or tincture can help symptoms that occur in the mouth. </p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b><br>
If you are starting radiation therapy, <a href="../access/drugs/amph.html">amphotericin B</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/pyri.html">pyrimethamine</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/sulf.html">sulfadiazine</a>, intravenous <a href="../access/drugs/tmp.html">Bactrim</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/ganc.html">ganciclovir</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/pent.html">pentamidine</a>, or <a href="../access/drugs/acyc.html">acyclovir</a>, you should discontinue ddC until you are stable on the other drugs.</p>

<font size=-1><p>Zidovudine or AZT, was the first drug approved for the treatment of AIDS. AZT is a an anti-HIV treatment in the same class of drugs as ddI, ddC, d4T and 3TC. These drugs are called nucleoside analogs. The body breaks down these drugs into chemicals that stop HIV from infecting uninfected cells in the body, but it does not help cells that have already been infected with the virus. As people with AIDS lose T4 cells - one of the immune systems main defenses - they become more likely to get infections and illnesses.</p>

<p>In a study looking at the effects of the drug in very sick people over the short term, AZT appeared to delay death. Researchers then tried to give AZT to healthier people with HIV to see if the drug would delay the development of serious AIDS-related infections. Two early studies suggested that AZT did help people maintain health. People taking AZT developed fewer infections than people who were taking the placebo. A placebo is a sugar pill used for comparison to see how well the treatment works.</p>

<p>However, recent studies have shown that AZT alone is not the best treatment for delaying the onset of AIDS. A study by the Veterans Administration found that, while AZT could slow the rate at which HIV-infected persons got AIDS-related infections, the drug did not help people live longer than people who were taking the placebo. More recently, the Concorde Study was a large study of early treatment with AZT. It also found that, while early AZT could slightly reduce AIDS-related infections, the drug did not extend life.</p>

<p>These study results have been confirmed by several large studies that compared combinations of AZT/ddI and AZT/ddC to AZT taken alone. These studies found that both combinations were more effective than AZT alone in preventing disease progression and death. For detailed results of these studies, see the Simple Facts Sheet on <a href="combo.html">Combination Therapy</a>.</p> 

<p>AZT is also now approved for use in combination with <a href="three.html">3TC</a>, because this combination has reduced the amount of HIV in the blood more than any other combination of approved drugs. However, the combination of AZT and 3TC has not yet been proven to extend life. Studies are ongoing to confirm that the reduction in HIV in the blood will help people stay healthy and live longer.</p>

<p>AZT is used to treat dementia which affects some people with AIDS. Symptoms of dementia can be forgetfulness and personality changes. AZT is also used to treat a blood disorder called thrombocytopenia, which means low levels of the cells that allow blood to clot.</p>

<p>A study has also shown that pregnant women treated with AZT were only one-third as likely to pass HIV on to their babies as women who didn't take AZT. This has led to a recommendation that HIV-positive pregnant women be counseled about the potential benefits of AZT in preventing the transmission of HIV to their child. </p>

<p>The lowest effective dose of AZT has not been determined, and the currently recommended dose is 300-600 mg per day. </p>

<p><b>Side effects</b><br>
Long-term AZT use is associated with loss of muscle. Other side effects can be anemia, white blood cell depression, lip, mouth and tongue sores, bone marrow damage, headaches, skin rash, itching, weakness, nervousness, dizziness, nausea, stomach pain, confusion, loss of speech or appetite, muscle aches, fever or sweating, sore throat or abnormal bruising or bleeding. </p>

<p>Studies indicate that possible blood cell damage may be prevented or treated by taking vitamin E, <a href="../access/drugs/eryt.html">epoeitin alpha</a> (EPO) or <a href="../access/drugs/filg.html">G-CSF</a> with this drug. AZT is best taken on an empty stomach. If you have stomach irritation, AZT may be taken with food. The capsules can be broken open and mixed with food right before eating if you have trouble swallowing. Nutritionists recommend taking manganese and B vitamins with this drug. </p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b><br>
The antibiotics <a href="../access/drugs/rifa.html">rifabutin</a> (Mycobutin) and <a href="../access/drugs/rifam.html">rifampin</a> can lower the amount of AZT in the blood. AZT should be used with caution in combination with other drugs that can suppress the bone marrow, such as ganciclovir.</p>

<h2 align=center><img align=middle hspace=2 src="../gifs/microsr.gif" 
alt="">viral load tests</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote>

<h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials for HIV currently enrolling, as well as other treatments, see the  <A HREF="../trials.html">clinical trials page</A>. </h5>

<HR align=center width=50% size=3 noshade>

<font size=-1>
<p>Viral load tests measure what's called HIV RNA. RNA is the part of HIV that knows how to make more virus. There are several different viral load tests, but only one is currently approved for general use. The approved viral load test is called the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test, better known as the PCR test. The PCR test has recently been approved by the FDA for use in checking the health of people with HIV, to see if they may be at risk for getting sick. The PCR test is also approved for checking the effects of anti-HIV drugs, to see if they are working against the virus.</p>

<p>Other viral load tests may be approved soon, including the branched DNA test (bDNA), which is made by a company called Chiron, and the NASBA test made by Organon. The results of each of these tests can be a little different, so doctors advise that people stick to the same type of test once they start using viral load testing. In this fact sheet all the viral load numbers from studies are based on what the result would be using the PCR test, as this is the most widely available test at the moment.</p>

<p><b>How do the tests work?</b><br>
Scientists have a good idea what some parts of HIV RNA look like. By creating a mirror image and matching it against what they find in someone's blood, they can find HIV RNA. The PCR test encourages the HIV RNA to make more of itself in a laboratory test tube. This makes it easier to measure the amount of HIV RNA that was originally in the blood sample. The bDNA test sets off a chemical reaction with the HIV RNA so it gives out light. Then the amount of light is measured in order to show how much RNA was found.</p>

<p>The results of these tests are usually given as number of HIV RNA copies per milliliter (ml) of blood, like the T4 cell count. The PCR test may give the number of HIV RNA copies per 0.05/ml, so you need to multiply the number by 20 to get the standard result. Results are also sometimes given as a number x 103, which means you have to add three zeros to the number - e.g. 40 x 103 is 40,000. This can get really confusing, so make sure you and your doctor are certain you are reading a viral load test result correctly before making any treatment decisions.</p>

<p><b>What do the numbers mean?</b><br>
Early viral load results from two large studies of a drug called delavirdine have recently been released. These studies found that the viral load test was a very good marker of disease progression. In these studies of around 1,700 people, viral load was better than T4 cell counts at showing whether someone might be at risk for getting sicker.</p>

<p>People who began the studies with a viral load of less than 20,000 had only a 1% chance of experiencing any disease progression during the approximately 60 weeks for which information has been collected. People who started with a viral load of between 20,000 and 200,000 had a slightly higher chance of disease progression. People who started with a viral load of over 200,000 had a 24% chance of disease progression.</p>

<p>Treatment that reduced viral load was linked to improved health. Improved health was most noticeable in people who started the studies with a viral load of over 20,000. For these people, a reduction in viral load of 70% or more for as little as 8 weeks reduced their chance of experiencing any disease progression by half during the study period of a little over a year.</p>

<p>Recent studies of triple combinations of anti-HIV drugs have shown that it is possible to reduce the levels of HIV in the blood to levels too low for the PCR test to measure. The current PCR test cannot find less than 400 copies of HIV RNA in a blood sample. This kind of reduction in viral load may not be possible for everyone, but may become the ideal goal of anti-HIV treatment. The only <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/special/hiv/library/jama96/st6007.htm">guidelines for using viral load testing</a> that have been released so far come from a group of doctors called the International AIDS Society USA. These guidelines suggest that keeping the viral load below 5,000 copies may also be a good goal for treatment.</p>

<p>There is still concern that there is a lot of virus in other places in the body, not just the blood. Only 2% of HIV is in circulating blood. The rest is in your lymph system and other body tissue. Early results indicate that changes in viral load in the blood are mirrored in the lymph system, but research is ongoing. Also, measuring the good effect an HIV treatment has on the viral load doesn't take into account any bad side-effects the treatment might have on the body. Further research will hopefully give people a clearer idea of how best to use viral load tests.</p>

<p><b><a name="medicaid">Viral</a> load tests and Medicaid</b><br>
PCR viral load testing should now be covered by Medicaid. In New York State, the reimbursement code currently used for the test is #87179, and this information may be helpful to your provider if they are unsure how to go about ordering the test. Other state Medicaid programs may also be able to use this code if they are unsure how to cover the test. Eventually, the viral load test will be assigned its own unique code for reimbursement through Medicaid, but it takes a while for this process to be completed. If you are having problems getting viral load testing covered by your state Medicaid program, call the Access Project at (800) 734-7104.</p>

<p>The number to call for information on the Chiron bDNA test is (800) 642-4657 x2909. Reimbursement assistance for the Chiron bDNA test is available by calling (800) 775-7533.</i></p>

<TITLE>Simple Facts Sheets: cryptococcal meningitis</TITLE>

<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff>

<h2 align=center><img align=middle hspace=2 src="../gifs/pilliv.gif" 
alt="">cryptococcal meningitis</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials for cryptococcal meningitis currently enrolling see the  <A HREF="../trials/menin.html">clinical trials page</A>. </h5>

<HR align=center width=50% size=3 noshade>

<font size=-1><p>Cryptococcal meningitis is a brain infection caused by a fungus called cryptococcus neoformans, found mainly in dirt and bird droppings. Many people have been exposed to the cryptococcus fungus at some time during their lives, but the immune system usually stops the fungus from causing illness.</p>

<p>When the immune system is weakened by HIV, the fungus can cause illness. The most common illness caused by the cryptococcus fungus is cryptococcal meningitis. Meningitis means swelling of the meninges. The meninges are membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Cryptococcal meningitis is a serious infection.</p>

<p>The symptoms can be similar to other conditions, but it is important to be aware of the possibility of cryptococcal meningitis. Watch for fever, vomiting, headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, and a general feeling of not being well. Sometimes symptoms include a stiff neck and seizures. You may experience all or just a few of these symptoms.</p>

<p>The standard treatment for cryptococcal meningitis is <a href="../access/drugs/amph.html">amphotericin B</a>, which must be given by intravenous injection. Treatment with amphotericin B is usually done in the hospital until the infection is brought under control The first part of the treatment is called induction treatment and usually takes less than two weeks. The doctor checks the spinal fluid using a procedure called a spinal tap, and measures what's known as the cryptococcal titer to see if the infection is under control.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, amphotericin B is well known for causing many side effects, including fevers, chills, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, diarrhea, kidney damage, and suppression of bone marrow which can lead to anemia. Despite these side effects, amphotericin B is the best drug for bringing cryptococcal infections under control, so it's important to try and get through the induction treatment and remember that things will get better.</p>

<p>Once the infection is under control, <a href="../access/drugs/fluc.html">fluconazole (Diflucan)</a> is used to prevent the cryptococcal infection from coming back. This is called maintenance treatment. Fluconazole is a pill. Compared to amphotericin B, fluconazole has few side effects. The most common are headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. Elevation in liver function tests is possible, but rare. There have recently been reports of reversible hair loss after long term use of fluconazole. For people who can't tolerate fluconazole, a drug called itraconazole may be an alternative.</p>

<p>A recent important finding is that severe headache and nausea in people with cryptococcal meningitis can be a sign of pressure build-up around the brain. This pressure, known as the intracranial pressure, can be checked by the doctor. If the intracranial pressure is high, it can be relieved by the removal of small amounts of spinal fluid and treatment with a drug called acetazolamide.</p>

<p>Alternatives to standard amphotericin B are currently being studied. <a href="../trials/fungal.html#nex">Liposome encapsulated amphotericin B</a> is a newer form of amphotericin B. (See also <a href="../../pwahg/info/ampho.html">PWA Health Group info sheet</a>.) The drug is put inside microscopic fat bubbles called liposomes and, hopefully, causes fewer side effects when given this way. AmBisome is a liposomal version of amphotericin B currently available through a compassionate use program. The program can provide AmBisome to people who are unable to tolerate standard treatment, or who are at a high risk for getting side effects from, standard amphotericin B. Doctors can call (800) 787-8268 for more information.</p>

<p><i>Pfizer, Inc., the makers of fluconazole (Diflucan), have a <a href="../access/pa/fluc.html">patient assistance program</a> for people having trouble accessing the drug. Call (800) 646-4455 for more information.</i></p>

</A>
(1) Although HIV-infected persons cannot avoid exposure to Cryptococcus 
neoformans completely, avoiding sites that are likely to be heavily contaminated 
with C. neoformans (e.g., areas heavily contaminated with pigeon droppings) may 
reduce the risk of infection.<P>

<A NAME="mendis"><H3>Prevention of Disease</H3></A>

(2) Because of the low probability that the results will affect clinical decisions, 
routine testing of asymptomatic persons for serum cryptococcal antigen is not 
recommended (DIII).<P>

(3) Data from a prospective controlled trial indicate that fluconazole can reduce 
the frequency of cryptococcal disease among patients with advanced HIV disease; 
thus, physicians may wish to consider chemoprophylaxis for adult and adolescent 
patients with a CD4+ lymphocyte count of less than 50/uL (BI). However, such 
prophylaxis should not be offered routinely because of the relative infrequency of 
cryptococcal disease, the possibility of drug interactions, the potential for 
development of resistance, and the cost of prophylaxis (DII). The need for 
prophylaxis or suppressive therapy for other fungal infections (e.g., candidiasis) 
should be considered in the course of decisions about prophylaxis for 
cryptococcosis.<P>

<A NAME="menrec"><H3>Prevention of Recurrence</H3></A>

(4) Patients who complete initial therapy for cryptococcosis should receive lifelong 
suppressive treatment with fluconazole (AI).<P>

<A NAME="menped"><H3>Pediatric Note</H3></A>

(5) There are no data on which to base specific recommendations for children, but 
lifelong suppressive therapy with fluconazole after an episode of cryptococcosis is 
appropriate (CIII).<P>

<A NAME="menpreg"><H3>Note Regarding Pregnancy</H3></A>

(6) Although treatment with fluconazole is indicated to prevent the recurrence of 
cryptococcosis, this drug should be used with caution in pregnant women (CIII). At 
high doses, fluconazole has been associated with both fetal death and increased 
rates of fetal abnormalities in rats.<P>

<TITLE>Simple Facts Sheets: cryptosporidiosis</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff>

<h2 align=center>cryptosporidiosis</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials for cryptosporidiosis currently enrolling, as well as for other conditions, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/ois.html">Drugs for treating opportunistic infections</A>.</h5>

<hr size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<blockquote><font size=2><p>Cryptosporidiosis is caused by Cryptosporidium, a protozoa infection that usually infects the gastrointestinal tract. The most common symptom is diarrhea along with cramping abdominal pain. The diarrhea can be profuse and watery. Infection can also cause loss of appetite and vomiting. In people whose immune systems aren't compromised, infection is either without symptoms or symptoms go away on their own, usually in 30 days. However, in young children and immunocompromised adults, infection can cause severe and lengthy illness. Diagnosis is made by the identification of the parasite in fecal smears or by intestinal biopsy. Cryptosporidiosis has recently been added to the list of infections that must be reported by doctors and other health-care providers to the New York City Department of Health.</p>

<p>The primary way of getting infected is person to person via the fecal-oral route. Those at highest risk are young children, especially those in day care, those who engage in oral-anal sex, and close personal contacts of infected patients. Some outbreaks have been traced to water supply systems.</p>

<p>Cryptosporidiosis was first found in a human in 1976. Before that, cryptosporidiosis was thought to only infect animals and was considered a veterinary problem. Around 1983, the number of human cases began to rise.  Increases in HIV infection have led to a rise in cryptosporidiosis infection. For a person living with HIV, cryptosporidiosis may cause dangerous dehydration and malnutrition. Diarrhea leads to dehydration, and your body can't function without maintaining adequate levels of water.</p>

<p>Symptoms of cryptosporidiosis include abdominal cramping, especially in the right side, nausea, and diarrhea lasting up to 21 days.</p></font>

<p><font size=3><b>Treatments</b></font><br>
<font size=2>Treatments include <a href="../access/drugs/paro.html">paromomycin</a> (Humatin) and azithromycin. Humatin is currently in an ongoing <a href="../trials/crypto.html#humatin">trial</a>. Participants are divided into two groups. One group will take humatin, the other group will take placebo. Neither the doctor nor the participant will know which treatment is being given. Treatment is for three weeks. For more information about this trial, call The Network. Humatin is also available through prescription.</p>

<p><a href="../trials/crypto.html#azithro">Azithromycin</a> is available from the drug company that makes it through a treatment IND for people who have failed or can't take conventional treatments. Azithromycin is a pill. Treatment of symptoms can include Immodium, octreotides or opiates for the diarrhea. Hyperimmune bovine collostrum is being tested as a means to increase the body's production of natural immunoglobulins used in fighting crypto. Total parenteral nutrition, or intravenous feeding is sometimes recommended to replace nutrients. High fat foods should be avoided as they are hard to digest and increase diarrhea. Foods containing lactose - dairy products such as cheeses, milk, and ice cream - produce similar effects.</p>

<p>Handwashing, especially after using the bathroom and during food preparation, is crucial in preventing the spread of crypto, as well as hepatitis and other infections. Safe sex practices reduce the risk of crypto. Boiling all drinking water for at least 1 minute is recommended for people with less than 200 T4 cells. This has been shown to kill the cryptosporidia that causes diarrhea.</p>

<p>Other treatments under investigation are <a href="../trials/crypto.html#clarithro">clarithromycin</a>, and <a href="../trials/crypto.html#ntz">NTZ</a>.  For information about these studies call the Network at (800) 734-7104. See also report on results of <a href="../altx.html#alicin">small garlic trial</a> in Los Angeles.</p>

<P><I>For <a href="../access/pa/azit.html">expanded access azithromycin</a>, doctors can call (800) 441-6148. This drug is also available through the New York State AIDS Institute AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). For information about ADAP, call (800) 542-2437. To report cases of cryptosporidiosis, and for more information about treatments, doctors and other health care providers can call the NYC DOH at (212) 788-4204.</I></p>

<A NAME="cryprev"><H3>Prevention of Exposure</H3></A>

(1) HIV-infected persons should be educated and counseled about the many ways 
that Cryptosporidium can be transmitted. Modes of transmission include contact 
with infected adults and diaper-age children, contact with infected animals, 
consumption of contaminated drinking water, and contact with contaminated water 
during recreational activities (BIII).

(2) HIV-infected persons should avoid contact with human and animal feces. They 
should be advised to wash their hands after contact with human feces (e.g., 
during diaper changing), after handling of pets, and after gardening or other 
contact with soil. HIV-infected persons should avoid sexual practices such as oral-
anal intercourse that may result in oral exposure to feces (BIII).<P>

(3) HIV-infected persons should be advised that newborn and very young pets 
may pose a small risk of cryptosporidial infection, but they should not be advised 
to destroy or give away healthy pets. Persons contemplating the acquisition of a 
new pet should avoid bringing any animal with diarrhea into their households, 
should avoid purchasing a dog or cat less than 6 months of age, and should not 
adopt stray pets. HIV-infected persons who wish to assume the small risk of 
acquiring a puppy or kitten less than 6 months of age should request that their 
veterinarian examine the animal's stool for Cryptosporidium before they have 
contact with the animal (BIII).<P>

(4) HIV-infected persons should avoid exposure to calves and lambs and to 
premises where these animals are raised (BII).<P>

(5) HIV-infected persons should not drink water directly from lakes or rivers. 
Because water can be accidentally ingested, patients should be advised that 
swimming in lakes, rivers, or public swimming pools may put them at increased 
risk for infection (BII).<P>

(6) Several outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been linked to municipal water 
supplies. During outbreaks or in other situations in which a community "boil-
water" advisory is issued, boiling of water for 1 minute will eliminate the risk of 
cryptosporidiosis (AI). Use of submicron personal-use water filters <A HREF="crypto.html#*">*</A> (i.e., 
home/office types) and/or bottled water <A HREF="crypto.html#**">**</A> <A HREF="crypto.html#2">(2)</A> may reduce the risk (CIII). The 
magnitude of the risk of acquiring cryptosporidiosis from drinking water in a non-
outbreak setting is uncertain, and current data are inadequate to recommend that 
all HIV-infected persons boil or avoid drinking tap water in nonoutbreak settings. 
However, HIV-infected persons who wish to take independent action to reduce the 
risk of waterborne cryptosporidiosis may choose to take precautions similar to 
those recommended during outbreaks. Such decisions should be made in 
conjunction with health care providers. Persons who opt for a personal-use filter or 
bottled water should be aware of the complexities involved in selecting appropriate 
products, the lack of enforceable standards for the destruction or removal of 
oocysts, the cost of the products, and the logistic difficulty of using these products 
consistently. <P>

<A NAME="crypdis"><H3>Prevention of Disease</H3></A>

(7) No effective chemoprophylactic agents are available for cryptosporidiosis. <P>

<A NAME="cryprec"><H3>Prevention of Recurrence</H3></A>

(8) No drug regimens are known to be effective in preventing the recurrence of 
cryptosporidiosis. <P>

<A NAME="cryped"><H3>Pediatric Note</H3></A>

(9) At present, no data indicate that formula-preparation practices for infants 
should be altered in an effort to prevent cryptosporidiosis (CIII).<P>

<A NAME="2">2</A>. CDC. Projections of the number of persons diagnosed with AIDS and 
the number of immunosuppressed HIV-infected persons--United States, 1992-
1994. MMWR 1992;41(No. RR-18):1-29. <P>

<A NAME="*">*</A> Only filters capable of removing particles 1 um in diameter and larger should be considered. Filters that provide the greatest assurance of oocyst removal include those that operate by reverse osmosis, those labeled as "absolute" 1-um filters, and those labeled as meeting NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) standard no. 53 for "cyst removal." The "nominal" 1-um filter rating is not standardized, and many filters in this category may not be capable of removing greater than or equal 
to 99% of oocysts.<P>

<A NAME="**">**</A> Sources of bottled water (wells, springs, municipal tap-water supplies, rivers, lakes) and methods for its disinfection vary; therefore, all brands should not be presumed to be free of cryptosporidial oocysts. Water from wells and springs is much less likely to be contaminated by oocysts than water from rivers or lakes. Treatment of bottled water by distillation or reverse osmosis ensures oocyst 
removal. Water passed through an "absolute" 1-um filter or a filter labeled as 
meeting NSF standard no. 53 for "cyst removal" before bottling will provide nearly 
the same level of protection. Use of "nominal" 1-um filters by bottlers as the only 
barrier to cryptosporidia may not result in the removal of greater than or equal to 
99% of oocysts.<P>
