<B><FONT SIZE=5>Off-Line<FONT SIZE=3>(R)</FONT> Announces "Top 25" List for

Investor Relations Web Sites</B></FONT>



(Mpls, MN) -- Off-Line<FONT SIZE=2>(R)</FONT> announced its "Top 25" and

"Honorable Mention" lists for investor relations Web sites today.

The top pick was Bolt Beranek and Newman, followed by Xerox, Cray Research, 

and Chrysler.  Recipients are eligible to display Off-Line's "Top 25" 

designation on the IR portion of their Web site.<P>



According to Ross Kaplan, Editor, the list answers the question,"Which

companies do the best job of using the Web to keep shareholders and analysts

informed?"  Off-Line's ranking represents the most comprehensive study of IR

sites to date, encompassing more than 3,000 discrete visits to 1,000 Web

sites in two dozen countries.  In all, Off-Line(R) identified more than 170

discrete features currently found on IR sites.  The research was conducted

between October and December.<P>



While investor relations sites continue to display a great deal of variability,

 Kaplan noted two emerging trends.  "First, the breadth and depth of content 

is rapidly expanding.  While the core content for practically all

IR sites consists of press releases, company profiles, and financial reports,

the more ambitious sites now include such features as conference call

transcripts, company calendars, research coverage, and multi-lingual content

(both currencies and languages)."<P>



Second, Kaplan observed that IR Web sites are evolving from static to

dynamic applications.  "The best sites increasingly go beyond simply

informing shareholders and increasingly let them do things," he said.  "For

example, shareholders can now use the Web to enroll in a DRIP, tour company

facilities, and even project earnings in a downloadable spreadsheet." <P>



The rankings and research methodology are featured in the current issue

of Off-Line(R), a groundbreaking publication that covers online technology

for companies, shareholders, and analysts.  Other articles in the current

issue include "Securities Analysts on the Web," "Who's Looking at Your Web

Site," and "IR on the Internet:  A Securities Disclosure Perspective."

Notable past articles include:  "Annual Meetings:  Put Them Online" and

"Corporate Governance and Technology."<P>



Off-Line(R) is published quarterly by Minneapolis-based Bulletin

Boardroom, Inc.  Annual subscriptions are available to IR professionals for

$375 (U.S.), and include unlimited access to Off-Line's Web site, available

mid-February.<P>

<hr>


<p>








        Auburn Hills, Mich. -- Chrysler Corporation today reported


first-quarter 1996 pretax earnings of $1,670 million, the highest


quarterly pretax earnings in the company's history.  First-quarter 


1996 pretax earnings increased $700 million, or 72


percent, over first-quarter 1995 pretax earnings of $970 million.


<P>


	Net earnings were $1,005 million, or $2.64 per common share


($2.61 per fully diluted common share), compared to first-quarter


1995 net earnings of $496 million, or $1.33 per common share


($1.23 per fully diluted common share). First-quarter 1996 net


earnings and earnings per share were Chrysler's best first


quarter ever.


<P>


	Included in first-quarter 1995 net earnings were charges of


$96 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the adoption of the


consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 95-1 and $71


million ($115 million pretax), or $0.20 per common share, for a


voluntary minivan owner service action.


<P>


	"The year got off to a stronger start than we expected with


first-quarter industry sales in the U.S. running at an annual


rate of 15.7 million units," said Chrysler  Chairman Robert J.


Eaton.  "The spring market looks very solid and we are increasing


our U.S. industry sales forecast  for the 1996 calendar year to


15.3 million units -- up from 15.1 million previously.


<P>


        "Despite all of the weather problems in the first quarter, our


retail sales still showed a healthy increase as compared to last


year.  Our share of the U.S. and Canadian new vehicle marketplace


jumped from 15.0 percent in the first quarter of 1995 to 16.3


percent in the first quarter of 1996.


<P>


	"We're in great shape heading into the spring market.  Our


overall vehicle inventories are right where we like to see them.


Retail car sales have gained momentum, showing month to month


improvement.  Demand for minivans, sport utility vehicles and


pickup trucks remains very strong.  In fact, the Dodge Ram is now


the fourth best selling vehicle in the country, up from eleventh


place a year ago," Eaton added.


<P>


	"The new Plymouth Breeze is off to a quick start and volume


production of the new Chrysler Sebring Convertible is available


just as people are starting to think about putting the top down,"


Eaton said.  "And the new 1997 Jeep Wrangler gives us the newest


and most capable vehicle in the small sport utility segment."





<P>


Other first-quarter highlights include:


<P>


<UL>





      <LI>Total revenues were $15.0  billion for first-quarter 1996 --


        a new first-quarter record for Chrysler and an increase of


        $1.4 billion, or 10 percent, over first-quarter 1995 total


        revenues of $13.6 billion.





       <LI>Net earnings as a percent of total revenues increased to 6.7


        percent in first-quarter 1996, compared with 3.6 percent in


        first-quarter 1995.





       <LI>Chrysler's worldwide factory shipments in first-quarter 1996


        were 753,176 units, compared to 714,765 for the same period


        in 1995.





       <LI>Chrysler's combined U.S. and Canadian retail unit sales of


        cars and trucks in first-quarter 1996 were 644,678 units,


        compared to 573,132 units for the same period in 1995.





       <LI>International retail sales in first-quarter 1996 were 53,243


        vehicles, up 41 percent over first-quarter 1995 sales of


        37,721 vehicles.  In Europe, Chrysler sold 24,302 vehicles


        in first-quarter 1996, an increase of 38 percent over 17,590


        vehicles in first-quarter 1995.





       <LI>Chrysler repurchased $332 million of its common stock in the


        first quarter of 1996.  As previously announced, the company


        has initiated a $2 billion common stock buyback for 1996,


        subject to market and general economic conditions.  Chrysler


        completed a $1 billion common stock buyback in 1995.





       <LI>Chrysler Financial Corporation (CFC) reported first-quarter


        pretax earnings of $154 million and first-quarter net


        earnings of $98 million -- CFC's highest quarterly earnings


        ever.  First-quarter 1996 pretax earnings were 41 percent


        higher than first-quarter 1995 pretax earnings of $109


        million, while net earnings were 42 percent higher than


        first-quarter 1995 net earnings of $69 million.

<p>

     HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corporation today reported its highest

ever quarterly pretax earnings of $1,659 million for the fourth quarter of

1995.  Calendar-year 1995 pretax earnings were $3,449 million, Chrysler's

third-best year.

<p>

     Chrysler also announced fourth-quarter 1995 net earnings of $1,040

million, or $2.67 per fully diluted common share, and 1995 calendar-year net

earnings of $2,025 million, or $5.11 per fully diluted common share.

Fourth-quarter 1995 net earnings were Chrysler's second-best quarter ever.

1995 calendar-year net earnings were the third highest in Chrysler's history.

<p>

     Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton said:

<p>

     "Our exceptional 1995 results confirm that our strategy of focusing on the

core automotive business, continually delighting our customers with new and

improved vehicles, preserving financial flexibility and balancing short- and

long-term shareholder returns continues to be successful.

<p>

     "In fact, 1995 -- the third most profitable year in our history -- was an

outstanding year for Chrysler in almost every respect despite a softening in

the automotive marketplace and the effect of our minivan changeover.  We

increased our common stock dividend twice in 1995 to an annualized $2.40 per

common share -- the highest dividend rate in our history.  We also repurchased

$1.1 billion of our common stock and expect to complete our cumulative $2

billion common stock repurchase program by the end of 1996, depending on market

conditions.  In 1995, we returned $1.8 billion to our shareholders in

dividends and stock buybacks.

<p>

     "Our all-new 1996 Dodge Caravan was named "Car of the Year" by Motor Trend

magazine, and all of our new minivans received "North American Car of the Year"

honors from a panel of journalists.  The new minivans have enjoyed a fantastic

reception in the marketplace.  During 1995, we also launched our full-size

Dodge Ram pickup truck at two additional facilities to put us in a strong

position to meet the growing demand for trucks.  We also launched our Chrysler

Sebring convertible and Plymouth Breeze.

<p>

     "In the International arena, we again enjoyed double digit growth in

retail sales with sales up 24 percent.  During 1995, we purchased distribution

rights in Brazil, Argentina and Japan, began building Jeep(R) Cherokees in

Thailand, opened parts distribution centers in Singapore, and Brussels,

Belgium, and announced plans to build an assembly plant in Argentina.

<p>

     "In 1996, we plan to open our new European headquarters in Brussels and

introduce four new right-hand-drive vehicles for markets like Japan, the United

Kingdom, Australia, and South Africa.

<p>

     "All in all, 1995 was a terrific year for our employees, dealers and

shareholders.  Based on the results we've announced today, we think we're doing

the right things and are on the right course for continued success in the

future."

<p>

     In fourth-quarter 1995, Chrysler changed its accounting treatment for

vehicles sold with minimum resale value guarantees to reflect the consensus on

Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales with a

Guaranteed Minimum Resale Value."  In accordance with the consensus, these

vehicle sales are now accounted for as operating leases.  Adoption of this

consensus, effective January 1, 1995, resulted in an after-tax charge of $96

million to first-quarter 1995 results which were restated.   

<p>

Calendar-year 1995

pretax earnings also include the previously announced charges of $263 million

and $115 million for production changes at the Newark assembly plant and the

voluntary minivan owner service action, respectively. 

<p>

Based on 1995 U.S. pretax

earnings, Chrysler will issue profit sharing payments averaging $3,200 to the

Company's U.S. hourly employees.  Checks will be distributed on February 16.

<p>

Other 1995 results include:

<p>

<ul>

<li>Chrysler's worldwide factory unit shipments in 1995 were 2,673,539,

    compared with 2,762,103 for 1994.

<p>

<li>Chrysler's retail unit sales in 1995 were 883,769 cars and

           1,505,696 trucks and minivans in the United States and Canada,

           compared with 929,138 cars and 1,522,609 trucks and minivans in

           1994.  Combined U.S. and Canada retail car and truck market share

           for 1995 was 14.7 percent, the same as 1994.

<p>

<li>International retail sales for 1995 totaled 157,741 units, up

           24 percent over 1994. Chrysler sold 84,573 vehicles in Europe in

           1995, an increase of 26 percent over 1994.

<p>

<li>   Chrysler Financial Corporation reported record fourth-quarter

           1995 net earnings of $97 million, an improvement of $43 million over

           fourth-quarter 1994, and record calendar-year 1995 net earnings of

           $339 million, an improvement of $144 million over 1994.

<p><h3><center>CHRYSLER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS



    



</h3></center>







<p>         HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corporation today announced third-quarter 1995 net earnings of $354 million, or $0.90 per fully diluted common share, compared with net earnings of $651 million, or $1.60 per fully diluted common share, for third-quarter 1994. 







<p>         Pretax earnings for the third quarter of 1995 were $582 million, compared with $1,063 million for the third quarter of 1994.   







<p>        The decline in earnings for the third quarter of 1995 as compared with the third quarter of 1994 was primarily due to lower minivan production volume, costs associated with the launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans and the launch of Chrysler's full-size Dodge Ram pickup truck at an additional facility, a leaner sales mix, higher incentives and the unfavorable economic conditions in Mexico. 







<p>        Commenting on the third quarter, Chrysler <a href="http://www2.chryslercorp.com/executive/executive.html">Chairman Robert J. Eaton</a> said:







<p>        "This quarter's results showed improvement over the second quarter and they rank as the third-best third quarter in the Company's history." 







<p>        "Customer response to our new minivans has been outstanding and we expect to be near full minivan production capacity by the end of the fourth quarter.  At the same time, Dodge Ram pickups and new Jeep (R) Grand Cherokees continue to rack up very strong sales.  Retail truck sales, including minivans, account for more than 60 percent of our total retail sales.  During the quarter, Chrysler also sold its 5 millionth minivan."







<p>        Net earnings for the first nine months of 1995 were $1,081 million, or $2.71 per fully diluted common share, compared with $2,545 million, or $6.24 per fully diluted common share, for the first nine months of 1994.  Pretax earnings for the first nine months of 1995 were $1,790 million, compared with $4,199 million for the first nine months of 1994.  Pretax earnings for the first nine months of 1995 include charges of $263 million and $115 million for production changes at the Newark assembly plant and the voluntary minivan owner service action, respectively.







<p>        Total revenues for the third quarter and the first nine months of 1995 were $12.0 billion and $38.1 billion, respectively, compared with $11.7 billion and $38.0 billion for the comparable 1994 periods. 







<p>        Chrysler's worldwide factory unit sales in the third quarter of 1995 were 581,853, compared to 593,757 for the same period of 1994.  Worldwide factory unit sales for the first nine months of 1995 were 1,931,769 compared with 2,037,157 in 1994.



   



<p>        Chrysler's retail unit sales in the third quarter of 1995 were 200,032 cars and 360,809 trucks and minivans in the United States and Canada, compared to 204,061 cars and 348,564 trucks and minivans in the third quarter of 1994. 



Combined U.S. and Canadian retail car and truck market share for third-quarter 1995 was 13.6 percent, compared with 13.5 percent in third-quarter 1994.







<p>        International retail sales for third-quarter 1995 totaled 40,120 units, up 27 percent over the same 1994 period. Chrysler sold 21,918 vehicles in Europe for third-quarter 1995, an increase of 36 percent over the same period in 1994.







<p>        During the third quarter of 1995, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved an increase in Chrysler's common stock repurchase program from $1 billion to $2 billion to be completed by the end of 1996, depending on market conditions.  Through the first nine months of 1995, Chrysler repurchased 17.4 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $782 million.







<p>        Chrysler Financial Corporation (CFC) reported record third-quarter 1995 net earnings of $87 million, an improvement of $37 million over third-quarter 1994.  The improvement in third-quarter 1995 net earnings over third-quarter 1994 net earnings is the result of higher levels of automotive financing and lower operating expenses.  Net earnings for the first nine months of 1995 were $242 million, an improvement of $101 million over the comparable 1994 period.  



   



<p>        The simultaneous release of third-quarter results, <a href="/chrysler/sec/">Form 10-Q</a> filing and availability of <a href="951011_2.html">financial statements</a> on the Internet is a first for Chrysler.

<p><h3><center>CHRYSLER REPORTS SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS

</h3></center>



<p>      Highland Park, Mich. -- Chrysler Corporation today reported

second-quarter 1995 net earnings of $135 million, or $0.34 per fully diluted

common share, compared with net earnings of $956 million, or $2.35 per fully

diluted common share, for second-quarter 1994. 



<p>        Pretax earnings for the second quarter of 1995 were $238 million, 

compared with $1,593 million for the second quarter of 1994.  Included in 

second-quarter 1995 pretax earnings is a charge of $232 million ($143 million 

after tax) relating to planned production changes at Chrysler's Newark assembly 

plant.



<p>        The decline in earnings for the second quarter of 1995 as compared with

the second quarter of 1994 was primarily due to lower production volume and

costs associated with the model changeover and launch of the company's all-new

minivans, the charge related to the Newark assembly plant, higher incentives

and material costs, a leaner sales mix, and lower sales in Mexico. 

        

<p>        Commenting on the second quarter, Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton

said:



<p>        "Obviously the second quarter was disappointing, but it was not a

surprise to us.  The launch of our all-new 1996 minivans resulted in lower

production and we took aggressive incentive actions to reduce our 1995 model

inventories. 



<p>        "The first six months of 1995 have reminded us just how competitive the

auto industry can be and how quickly the market can change.  Fortunately, we

reacted quickly late in the first quarter by constraining production while, at

the same time, offering strong retail incentives.  And those actions worked.



<p>        "Our record sales in May and June demonstrated the public's desire to

own Dodge and Plymouth Neons, Dodge Rams, Jeep(R) Grand Cherokees and the

Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus,"  Eaton said.  "Our stocks of 1995 minivan

models have been nearly depleted while our dealers report that the new 1996

minivans are selling almost as fast as they can unload them from the trucks.



<p>        "The Company is now well positioned for the 1996 model year with

dealer inventories in line, an all-new Dakota pickup and Jeep Wrangler set to

debut next year, and a substantially revised and enhanced Jeep Grand Cherokee

going into production later this month.  We expect to have a very strong truck

lineup in the hottest segment of the industry with major new truck capacity

coming on stream.



<p>        "We are encouraged by the recent Federal Reserve action to reduce

interest rates and expect to see some moderation in incentives in the third and

fourth quarters.  We remain committed to our long-term strategic plans for the

Company and are well positioned for what we believe will be an improving market

leading to a strong 1996 model year."



<p>        Net earnings for the first six months of 1995 were $727 million, or

$1.81 per fully diluted common share, compared with $1,894 million, or $4.64

per fully diluted common share, for the first six months of 1994.  Pretax

earnings for the first half of 1995 were $1,208 million, compared with $3,136

million for the first six months of 1994.    



<p>        Total revenues for the second quarter and first six months of 1995 were

$12.5 billion and $26.1 billion, respectively, compared with $13.1 billion and

$26.3 billion for the comparable 1994 periods.



<p>        Chrysler's worldwide factory unit sales in the second quarter of 1995

were 635,151 units, compared to 702,802 for the same period in 1994.  Worldwide

factory unit sales for the first six months of 1995 were 1,349,916 compared

with 1,443,400 units in 1994.



<p>        Chrysler's retail unit sales of cars and trucks in the United States

and Canada in second-quarter 1995 were 680,505 units.  Combined U.S. and

Canadian retail car and truck market share for second-quarter 1995 was 15.2

percent, compared with 15.4 percent in second-quarter 1994.



<p>        International retail sales in second-quarter 1995 were 44,169, up 26

percent over second-quarter 1994.  Chrysler recently announced a $100 million

investment in Japan to strengthen its distribution system and bring it closer

to its customers in that important market.



<p>        Through the first six months of 1995, Chrysler repurchased 14.1 million

shares of its common stock at a cost of $608 million.



<p>        Chrysler Financial Corporation (CFC) reported second-quarter net

earnings of $86 million, an improvement of $42 million over second-quarter

1994.  The results represent CFC's best second quarter for net earnings.  The

improvement in earnings is the result of a higher volume of automotive

financing and lower bank costs.  CFC's net earnings for the six months ended

June 30, 1995 and 1994 were $155 million and $91 million, respectively.

<CENTER>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</CENTER>  


<p>NOTE 1. CONSOLIDATION AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION  


<p>     The consolidated financial statements of Chrysler Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Chrysler") include the accounts of all significant majority-owned subsidiaries and entities. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Chrysler for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1995 and 1994 reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring items, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1995 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year. Reference should be made to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994. Amounts for 1994 have been reclassified to conform with current period classifications.

<p>NOTE 3. SALES OF AUTOMOTIVE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS  


<p>     Chrysler sold its wiring harness operations and certain of its soft trim operations in the first and second quarters of 1994, respectively, and entered into long-term supply agreements with each of the purchasers. Aggregate net proceeds from the sales and the supply agreements were $315 million. The related pretax gains of $254 million were deferred and are being recognized over the periods of the respective supply agreements.



 


<p>NOTE 4. PREFERRED STOCK CONVERSION AND SUPPLEMENTARY EARNINGS PER SHARE DATA  


<p>     During the third quarter and the first nine months of 1995, holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converted 88,416 and 1,557,588 shares, respectively, of preferred stock into 2.5 and 43.3 million shares of common stock, respectively. Primary earnings per common share for the third quarter and the first nine months of 1995 were calculated based upon a weighted average of common shares outstanding which included the additional shares from the preferred stock conversions. If all of the preferred stock conversions had occurred on January 1, 1995, primary earnings per common share for the first nine months of 1995 would have been $2.73.



 


<p>NOTE 5. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  


<p>     During the third quarter of 1995, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved an increase in Chrysler's common stock repurchase program from $1 billion to $2 billion to be completed by the end of 1996, depending on market conditions.



During the third quarter and the first nine months of 1995, Chrysler repurchased 3.3 and 17.4 million shares, respectively, of its common stock under this program at a cost of $174 and $782 million (including $13 million in unsettled purchases), respectively.






<p>NOTE 6. SPECIAL PLANT PROVISION


 


<p>     During the second quarter of 1995, Chrysler recorded a $232 million provision for costs associated with production changes at Chrysler's Newark assembly plant. The plant ended production of Chrysler's LeBaron convertibles in July 1995. In addition, Newark production of the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid was reduced to one shift in August 1995 and will end prior to production of a new vehicle in the fall of 1997. The provision includes the recognition of supplemental unemployment benefits, job security benefits and other related employee costs, and the write-down of certain equipment and tooling. During the third quarter, this provision was increased by $31 million to $263 million, primarily reflecting changes in the estimate for job security benefit costs.

  <p>     This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental Operations on an Equity Basis)," reflects the results of operations of Chrysler with its investments in Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") and its investments in short-term vehicle rental subsidiaries (the "Car Rental Operations") accounted for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries. This Supplemental Information does not purport to present results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because it does not comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." Due to the fact that the operations of CFC and the Car Rental Operations are different in nature than Chrysler's manufacturing operations, management believes that this disaggregated financial data enhances an understanding of the consolidated financial statements.

<p>     This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental Operations on an Equity Basis)," reflects the financial position of Chrysler with its investments in CFC and the Car Rental Operations accounted for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries. This Supplemental Information does not purport to present financial position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because it does not comply with SFAS No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." The financial covenant contained in Chrysler's revolving credit facility is based on this Supplemental Information. In addition, because the operations of CFC and the Car Rental Operations are different in nature than Chrysler's manufacturing operations, management believes that this disaggregated financial data enhances an understanding of the consolidated financial statements.

<a name="share"><h3>TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS<BR>

CREATING AND DISTRIBUTING<BR>

SHAREHOLDER VALUE:<BR>

WE'RE NOW IN A POSITION TO MAXIMIZE BOTH.</h3></a>

<p>

<strong> In 1995 <A HREF="http://www2.chryslercorp.com/">Chrysler Corporation</A> returned $1.8 billion to shareholders</strong> through dividends and share repurchases. That's an amount equal to 88

percent of our after-tax 1995 earnings.<br><p>

     We increased our dividend twice last year to an annualized $2.40 per

common share-the highest rate in our history. We also repurchased $1.1 billion of our 

common stock and recently announced our intent to repurchase an additional 

$2 billion in 1996, subject to market and general economic conditions.<br><p>

     Those are numbers we're happy to report. We're also proud of our 1995

performance. Our net earnings topped $2 billion and were the third-highest in

Chrysler's history. <br><p>

     But we're even prouder of what we've been doing to increase the long-term

value of your investment in Chrysler. After all, as one of our shareholders

told us recently, "We didn't give you our money to have you simply turn around

and give it back to us."<br><p>

     You won't read much more in this report on distributing shareholder value.

<br>

<p>

     <strong>Our focus is on creating value.</strong> Over the long haul, outstanding products,

delighted customers, profitable growth and reinvestment in the business are the

requirements for building the value of your investment in our company. <br>

<p>

  <strong>It starts with financial stability,</strong> and from 1992 through 1994, we laid

the foundation for enduring strength. We fully funded our pension plans, which

had been among the largest unfunded plans in the industry. We paid down our

debt. We built our cash balances. Those steps used more than $14 billion of the

cash generated from our automotive operations during that period. But it helped

us accomplish an A-level credit rating and gave us newfound financial strength

and flexibility.<br><p>

     In short, we've turned one of Chrysler's biggest historical weaknesses

into one of its principal strengths for the future.<br><p>

     Staying competitive in the auto business is an enormously costly

challenge. But putting money back into the business is the only way to be

successful.<br><p>

     Sound financial footing is our launchpad for creating shareholder value.

We're building value in a number of ways:<br>

    <p><strong> We're investing in our products.</strong> Minivans represent more than 20 percent

of our volume, and in 1995 we launched our all-new minivans in three plants in

three countries. It was a big job and one we had to do right. We did. The

response from the public and the media has been enthusiastic, judging from the

strong sales, numerous Car of the Year honors and the many positive letters

we've received from our customers. Lost sales due to the minivan launch

affected our profitability in 1995, but the changeover allowed us to set a new

industry benchmark and add about 100,000 units of capacity. <br><p>

     We also strengthened our product lineup by adding the <A HREF="http://www.chryslercars.com/SebConvt/SebConvt.htm">Chrysler Sebring

Convertible</A> and <A HREF="http://www.plymouthcars.com/plymouth/showroom/breeze/brzHome.html">Plymouth Breeze</A>. And to showcase our growing international

presence, we introduced to the world a right-hand-drive version of the 1997

<A HREF="http://www.jeepunpaved.com/wrangler/wrangler.html">Jeep Wrangler&#174;</A> at the Tokyo Auto Show.<br>

    <p><strong> We're investing in product quality,</strong> which improved substantially in 1995.

Our trucks--including <A HREF="http://www.jeepunpaved.com/">Jeep&#174;</A> vehicles and minivans--were rated the best among

domestic products in the J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Survey.

Those vehicles represented 64 percent of our sales in 1995. J.D. Power also

rated Chrysler best among all domestic and import auto companies in quality

improvement. In the 1995 Strategic Vision Inc. Quality Index of "things gone

right," our cars and trucks took three of the top five positions in

70 percent of the categories, with the 

<A HREF="http://www.4adodge.com/neon/neon.html">Dodge Neon</A> and <A HREF="http://www.4adodge.com/ram/ram.html">Dodge Ram Pickup</A> taking

top honors. As measured by warranty experiences, we've improved our quality by

25 percent during the last three years. During the 1995 model year alone, our

vehicle quality improved 13 percent--the second best year-over-year improvement

in more than a decade. A lot of hard work went into that improvement--by our

employees and our suppliers. <br>

     <p><strong>We're building shareholder value by improving our processes and cutting

costs</strong> in our manufacturing and assembly plants, thanks in great part to

effective teamwork with our union partners. Our supplier facilities share this

focus. During 1995 we conducted 63 lean production workshops with 25 of our top

suppliers. In each workshop, team members from Chrysler and the supplier

companies worked side-by-side to improve quality while reducing inventories,

floor space, lead time, process variation and scrap. Our ongoing supplier cost

reduction effort, known as SCORE, resulted in savings of $765 million in

1995.<br>

    <p><strong> We're investing in our facilities.</strong> We launched our popular <A HREF="http://www.4adodge.com/ram/ram.html">Dodge Ram

Pickup</A> at two additional plants in St. Louis, Missouri, and Saltillo, Mexico,

to put us in a strong position to meet the growing demand for trucks. And we

announced three new production facilities--a transmission plant in Kokomo, Ind., and an engine

plant in Detroit and a new home for <A HREF="http://www.4adodge.com/viper/viper.html">Dodge Viper</A> and <A HREF="http://www.plymouthcars.com/plymouth/showroom/prowler/prowler.html">Plymouth Prowler </A>assembly,

also in Detroit. We're expanding our engine plant in Kenosha, Wis., to increase

our production capacity. And to help make the most of all of our investments in

manufacturing, we're putting in place the Chrysler Operating System, which will

provide our facilities a detailed road map that capitalizes on best practices

throughout our manufacturing organization.<br>

    <p><strong> We're investing in our people, </strong>through training and in the continuing

development of a corporate culture based on teamwork, empowerment and, yes,

inspiration. It takes inspired people to produce vehicles like our

one-of-a-kind <A HREF="http://www.plymouthcars.com/plymouth/showroom/prowler/prowler.html">Plymouth Prowler roadster</A>--a vehicle whose value may best be

measured by the spotlight it puts on our ingenuity and our risk-taking in

product design. A new computerized job-posting system, a new companywide

satellite employee television network and our new World Headquarters are all

part of the effort to create a culture at Chrysler that translates into a

competitive advantage.<br>

    <p><strong> We're investing in new markets. </strong>Profitable growth is the cornerstone of

shareholder value. Toward that end, we purchased distribution rights in Brazil,

Argentina and Japan; began building Jeep Cherokees in Thailand; opened parts

distribution centers in Belgium and Singapore; re-entered expanding markets in

Vietnam and South Africa; and announced plans to build an assembly plant in

Argentina. In 1996 we plan to open a new European headquarters in Brussels and

introduce four new right-hand-drive vehicles in Japan, the United Kingdom,

Australia and South Africa.<br>

    <p><strong> We're investing in customer satisfaction.</strong> Our customer-driven

product-creation process is a benchmark for our industry. Our owner loyalty

rate is higher today than it has been at any time since we've been measuring

it. We're now exploring new ways to communicate with customers. Our

customer-friendly, computer-based 

<A HREF="http://www.plymouthcars.com/plymouth/PPCentral/PPCentral.html">

Plymouth Place</A> information centers in

shopping malls have been well-received and have helped increase sales in test

markets.<br>

     <p><strong>These activities and achievements translate into long-term shareholder

value.</strong> Our financial strategy is designed to achieve the proper balance over

the long term between creating and distributing shareholder value. <br><p>

     This balance requires solid decisions on maintaining sufficient financial

flexibility and making capital investments designed to maximize growth in

earnings and return on investment in our core business. Cash that can't be used

to produce superior returns in our core business will continue to be returned

to shareholders.<br>

    <p><strong> Our momentum is strong</strong> and our focus is sharp. The new corporate culture

we've been striving to create has been taking hold. We're a company that we

believe embraces change faster and more eagerly than our competitors when it

comes to developing products and meeting customers' needs. But we're also

committed to bedrock principles of prudent financial management. No more

comebacks for Chrysler. We know how unforgiving the auto industry can be. We

are on a new path to ongoing stability. And we intend to stay on it.<br>

    <p><strong> As managers, our primary obligation is to our shareholders. </strong>Our goal is to

build and return value to our shareholders.<br><p>

     But we also know that the best way to serve shareholders is to put our

customers first. And we know that our shareholders won't be served unless our

employees are inspired and unless our dealers and our suppliers are partners in

our enterprise.<br><p>

     Managing a company always involves compromises between the short term and

long term. It also involves balancing the needs and interests of our various

stakeholders. We are fortunate today at Chrysler because the company has never

been in a better position to meet these challenges.<br><p>

     To achieve success, we have to manage the company with the understanding

that tomorrow's needs are as important as today's.<br>

    <p><strong> Our strategy isn't complicated.</strong> It means sticking to our core business,

following through on an aggressive product development program, focusing on

quality, continuously improving our operations, continuing to develop our

international markets, reducing costs and maintaining sustainable dividends and

a balance sheet strong enough to ensure not only stability, but also

prosperity, in a highly cyclical, capital-intensive industry.<br><p>

     Our management team has visited with many shareholders in the past year.

We've shared our strategy, asked questions and listened. We successfully

resolved an issue with one of our largest shareholders in a way that will allow

the Chrysler team to remain focused on building value for all of our shareholders. We remain

committed to growing this company and enhancing shareholder value. <br>

CHRYSLER'S PRODUCT<br>

DEVELOPMENT CENTERS:<br>

DESIGNED FOR TEAMWORK</center></h3>

<p>

<strong>Shareholder value comes from world-class facilities.<br></strong>

<p>

     When it opened in 1991, it was described as a monument to the end of

short-term thinking.<br><p>

    <strong> <A HREF="http://www2.chryslercorp.com/">The Chrysler Technology Center</A></strong> is a product development facility in Auburn

Hills, Mich., unmatched in the industry. Under one roof are all the people and

tools necessary for planning, developing and selling a new product--design,

engineering, manufacturing, business planning, program management, purchasing,

sales, marketing and finance. Its goal: to be the finest automotive research

and development facility in the world.<br><p>

     In 1995, the Chrysler Technology Center grew to 3.8 million square feet,

and another 550,000 square feet were added for the company's new World

Headquarters.<br><p>

     <strong>The complex represents an investment</strong> of $1.1 billion. And while the return

on that investment is difficult to quantify, the advantages that the facility

gives Chrysler are many. <br><p>

     A list of the reasons for Chrysler's success in recent years would include

the company's platform-team approach, standout products, greatly reduced

vehicle development time, unparalleled teamwork with suppliers and with each

other and an emerging new company culture built on an inspired, empowered work

force.<br><p>

     <strong>In each of those advantages, </strong>the Chrysler Technology Center and the

company's Jeep&#174;/Truck Engineering facility in Detroit have played key

roles.<br><p>

     Both facilities are designed to help people work together in teams.

Engineers work alongside purchasing specialists and suppliers, marketing and

finance specialists. In that environment, decisions are made quickly, without

unnecessary delays, bringing competitive products to market in the shortest

possible time.<br><p>

     The Chrysler Technology Center is especially designed to attract, inspire

and retain talented people. Skylights brighten the center's walkways. Outside

are paths winding through a natural setting, including more than 20 acres of

woods and wetlands.<br><p>

     <strong>Inside is a one-of-a-kind array</strong> of scientific test facilities, simulating

hundreds of real-world driving conditions in a controlled test environment. The

true advantage is having these comprehensive facilities just a short walk away

from the teams developing the product. The labs serve as a place for engineers

to share information throughout Chrysler's platform-team organization. <br><p>

     The facility houses state-of-the-art scientific and diagnostic equipment

that can resolve virtually any question our technical staffs can ask--quickly,

efficiently and precisely. A 3/8-scale wind tunnel, designed for use with clay

models, helps enhance the aerodynamics of future cars and trucks. Noise,

vibration and harshness chambers for vehicles and components simulate road

conditions so engineers can minimize and prevent buzzes, squeaks and rattles.

An environmental center tests vehicle emissions and exposes vehicles to

simulations of extreme heat, cold, rain, snow and altitude on a repeatable

basis. An electromagnetic compatibility center helps engineers test a vehicle's

various electronic systems to make sure they're immune to each other and to the

environment. Dynamometer cells in the power train test center provide engine

and transmission

testing. <br><p>

    <strong> In an on-site pilot manufacturing plant,</strong> engineers can anticipate and

solve production problems long before new vehicles start down the assembly

line.<br><p>

     A 1.8-mile evaluation road augments the company's more comprehensive

proving grounds in Chelsea, Mich., and Wittmann, Ariz. Chrysler's Auburn Hills

complex also includes a modern, multimedia education center that makes it easy

and convenient for employees to develop their skills and careers.<br><p>

     With the completion of the World Headquarters in 1996, the complex will

house approximately 10,000 employees, providing an environment that promotes

face-to-face communication and the tools and sophisticated technologies to make

us a world-class car and truck producer.<br>

<a name="manuf"><h3>INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING:<br>

HELPING CHRYSLER GENERATE<br>

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES</h3></a>

<p>

<strong>Shareholder value comes from manufacturing excellence.</strong><br>

<p>

    <strong> Plain and simple, Chrysler is a manufacturing company. </strong>

About 80 percent of

the company's employees are involved in manufacturing components or assembling

them into vehicles. Investing in our manufacturing facilities and people is key

to building shareholder value.<br><p>

     That investment takes many forms. Over the next five years, Chrysler will

spend $350 million in training its manufacturing employees, as the company

looks to employees for input on ways to continuously improve our

vehicle-building process. Additional training is available through UAW/Chrysler

National Training Center facilities across the United States.<br><p>

     The investment by the UAW and Chrysler in a Product Quality Improvement

Partnership has paid handsome returns. Since the partnership began in 1980,

more than 1,000 teams have been formed to address quality issues and, in the

process, millions of dollars have been saved. Today, 32 percent of the hourly

work force in Chrysler manufacturing is deployed in self-directed teams. That's

more than 25,000 UAW members who have responsibility for designing work

stations, quality assurance, productivity improvements and the like.<br><p>

     <strong>The development of a "virtual manufacturing facility"</strong> is one investment

that could help Chrysler further reduce the time it takes to develop its

products by 20 percent. Working with Dassault Systemes, Chrysler has developed

a fully computerized product and process management system designed to create a

seamless link between product development and manufacturing. Most important,

it's an integrated approach that connects all platform team members by

computer. <br><p>

     The aim of the system is to simulate and validate all manufacturing

processes. Engineers will be able to tune key elements--robot programming,

assembly sequences, ergonomics--to see exactly how they affect the cycle time

and build quality of the vehicle. They will also be able to test those

practices and procedures on the plant floor through the computer--long before

the first tool is made.<br><p>

     <strong>Timely investments in manufacturing facilities</strong> have helped Chrysler

capitalize on key market opportunities in recent years. Through a series of

adaptations to increase production capacity, Chrysler has been able to take

advantage of the growing market for trucks, minivans and sport-utility

vehicles. In 1990 Chrysler had less

than 1 million units of capacity on a two-shift straight-time basis for

pickups, minivans and sport-utilities combined. In 1996 we'll have nearly 1.7

million units of straight-time capacity. And with overtime and three shifts at

some plants, total truck capacity could top 2 million units. <br><p>

     <strong>Over the next five years,</strong> Chrysler will make a series of investments for

new power trains, plant modernization and quality-

related programs.<br><p>

     Some $4 billion will be invested in power train and component facilities,

including construction of a new transmission plant near Kokomo, Ind., and a new

engine plant in Detroit. The $1 billion Kokomo plant will produce

state-of-the-art, fully electronic transmissions for the next generation of

Jeep(R) vehicles and Dodge trucks. Chrysler is investing $750 million to

convert its New Mack Avenue Viper Assembly Plant in Detroit into an engine

plant with construction beginning in 1996. By 1998 the 926,000-square-foot

facility will be producing all-new V-8 engines for Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge

Ram and Dakota models for the 1999 model year. The plant will also begin

producing next-generation V-6 engines for the 2000 model year. The plant will

have the capacity to build about 600,000 engines a year. In 1995 Chrysler also

acquired a 345,000-square-foot plant in Detroit for Dodge Viper and Plymouth

Prowler assembly.<br><p>

    <strong> In addition, Chrysler is investing</strong> $300 million to expand its Kenosha

(Wis.) Engine Plant for production of an all-new multivalve 2.7-liter V-6

engine for use in 1998 model year vehicles. The engine will be used in the

next-generation <A HREF="http://www.chryslercars.com/Concorde/Concorde.htm">Chrysler Concorde</A>,

<A HREF="http://www.4adodge.com/intrepid/intrepid.html"> Dodge Intrepid</A> and

 <A HREF="http://www.eaglecars.com/viewing/vision/vision.html">Eagle Vision</A> sedans. <br><p>

     Another $4 billion will be invested in assembly plants to build and

install new paint shops and equipment and machinery for future models. And $2

billion will be used to upgrade stamping plants with new, more efficient

presses.<br><p>

     <strong>Chrysler has made great strides</strong> in recent years in improving the

efficiencies of its manufacturing processes and practices. The results are

beginning to show. Four of Chrysler's truck plants made the J.D. Power and

Associates list of the 10 best plants in initial quality in 1995. According to

the Harbour Report, the company remains the lowest-cost producer in North

America. And the successful launch of the company's all-new minivan at three

plants in three countries in 1995 provided further evidence of our

manufacturing capabilities. <br><p>

     To achieve further improvement, Chrysler studied 200 companies as part of

an effort to develop a manufacturing strategy that gives it a competitive

advantage. After months at the drawing board, the result is the Chrysler

Operating System--a road map to systematically:<br><p>

<ul>

<li>identify the most qualified individuals and find ways to involve and empower

them to improve their operations and the environment in which they work,

<li>develop predictive and preventive maintenance programs to maintain efficient

machinery that is constantly capable of meeting customer requirements,

<li>achieve smooth, consistent and predictable product schedules day after day,

and

<li>focus all our efforts on continuous improvement by being able to quickly

identify the root cause of problems and implement solutions.

</ul>



<strong>The Chrysler Operating System is designed</strong> to result in lower-cost vehicles

with even better quality delivered on time to our customers. It's also designed

to promote a safe work environment and to inspire and empower work teams--all

of which, in the end, builds value for our shareholders.

<a name="market"><h3>CHRYSLER'S PRESENCE<br>

IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS:<br>

GROWING STRONGER EVERY YEAR</h3></a></center>

Shareholder value comes from profitable growth in

new markets.

<p>

     <strong>Expansion overseas has become</strong> an important means of delivering long-term

value to our shareholders. And, somewhat ironically, we believe we can deliver

value because we do not have large overseas manufacturing and product

development organizations.<br><p>

     In the past, when some American cars were 20-foot, 5,000-pound land

yachts, it was necessary to have separate products and separate operations in

other parts of the world. But today, a <A HREF="http://www.plymouthcars.com/plymouth/showroom/neon/neon.htm">Neon</A>

 or <A HREF="http://www.4adodge.com/stratus/stratus.html">Stratus sedan</A> or a 

<A HREF="http://www.jeepunpaved.com/grand_cherokee/grand_cherokee.html">

Jeep&#174; GrandCherokee</A> looks as much at home

on the streets of Tokyo or Paris as on the streets of America. That's why

Chrysler's international expansion strategy relies primarily upon North

American-built exports, plus prudent additional growth opportunities in areas

such as right-hand-drive and kit-assembly operations overseas.<br><p>

     <strong>This didn't happen by accident.</strong> A few years ago, we set out to incorporate

the best of what we've come to call the "international design ethic" in

vehicles that would carry a distinctive Chrysler Corporation stamp. We wanted

to bring the best of both the European and Japanese design ethics to the new

products of what once was a very conservative, very American carmaker. <br><p>

     And, beginning with our family of cab-forward mid-size sedans, we did just

that.<br><p>

     <strong>Absorbing international design</strong> and engineering concepts has helped us in

both North American and international markets.<br><p>

     Four years ago, we had total international revenues of $1.3

billion. In 1995 we've more than doubled that with revenues of

$3.6 billion.<br><p>

     In 1995 our international shipments--including exports, European

production of minivans and 

<A HREF="http://www.jeepunpaved.com/grand_cherokee/grand_cherokee.html">Jeep Grand Cherokee</A> vehicles in Graz, Austria, and

kit-assembled units--increased 29 percent over 1994. <br><p>

     Shipments grew 28 percent in Europe, 29 percent in the Asia/Pacific

region, 44 percent in the Middle East, and 43 percent in Latin America and

Africa.<br><p>

     <strong>Our strategy for capitalizing on international markets</strong> is continuing to

evolve. In the first phase of our international expansion strategy, we

re-entered the global arena a few years ago primarily as an exporter of North

American vehicles. We entered the second growth phase by adding right-hand

drive, diesel engines and other features appropriate to various markets. In

1995, products sold in international markets represented nearly 8 percent of

our company's sales volume.<br><p>

     Along the way, our North American products have benefited from our

international experience. For example, the 1996 Neon we're selling in Europe

incorporates major changes requested by European customers.We have incorporated

some of those changes in the Neon models we sell in our home markets as well.

<br><p>

     <strong>Our all-new minivans provide</strong> an example of how we've integrated

international and North American product development. From the first day of

development, we made international considerations part of our planning, and as

a result, we were able to make European versions available overseas only a few

months after the vehicles debuted in North America. <br><p>

     The third phase of our international strategy is to study products

developed by our platform teams in North America for sale exclusively in other

continents.<br><p>

    <strong> To continue our successful growth pattern,</strong> we know we have to carefully

pinpoint specific opportunities that are worthy of our investment.<br><p>

     In 1995 we announced plans to develop a new plant in Argentina to produce

<A HREF="http://www.jeepunpaved.com/grand_cherokee/grand_cherokee.html">Grand Cherokee</A> models for Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. We also

expanded our presence in Japan in 1995 by investing $100 million to develop our

own distribution system. <br><p>

     And we made a major commitment to our future in Japan, the United Kingdom,

Australia and South Africa by investing in right-hand-drive models. By the end

of 1996, our <A HREF="http://www.plymouthcars.com/plymouth/showroom/VoyGVoy/VoyGvoy.htm">

Voyager minivan</A>, 

<A HREF="http://www.plymouthcars.com/plymouth/showroom/neon/neon.htm">

Neon</A> and each of our <A HREF="http://www.jeepunpaved.com">Jeep&#174; vehicles</A>--Wrangler,

Cherokee and Grand Cherokee--will be available as right-hand-drive models.<br><p>

     <strong>Outside of North America, Chrysler now assembles</strong> vehicles in Austria,

China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Venezuela and Egypt, but because we

continue to export vehicles as well, employees in North America also benefit. A

perfect example can be seen at our assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio. Nearly 40

percent of all Jeep Cherokee vehicles produced there are shipped outside the

United States. In fact, nearly half of all Cherokees assembled worldwide are

for customers outside North America.<br><p>

     Today, we believe we have perhaps the widest range of core products suited

for multinational applications of any automaker in the world. We believe that

Chrysler and our shareholders have benefited tremendously from the company's

drive to capitalize on opportunities in international markets.<br>

CHRYSLER'S PRODUCT LINEUP<br>

AS DESCRIBED BY OUR CUSTOMERS</h3></a></center>

<p>

<strong>Shareholder value comes from delighted customers.</strong><br>

<p>

    <strong> A satisfied customer is one thing;</strong> a delighted customer is something else.

Delighting the customer is a rallying cry within Chrysler. Sometimes, when we

hit the mark, our customers let us know.<br><p>

     "What a dream! Way to go!" wrote Janet Vogelzang of Vallejo, Calif., about

her <A HREF="http://www.plymouthcars.com/plymouth/showroom/VoyGVoy/VoyGvoy.htm">

Plymouth Voyager</A> minivan. "It just can't get any better," said another

Voyager owner from Apache Junction, Ariz. 

<br><p>Here are more expressions of delight

from Chrysler minivan owners:<br><p>

     <strong>"You've really done your homework</strong> with this one," wrote

Dr. Daniel Hanle of Southbury, Conn. "An absolute and total thrill. Has nicer

chairs and stereo system than my house," wrote Rebecca Mocciaro of Los Angeles.

"It's like sitting in my own living room," wrote Bernice Staton of Kissimmee,

Fla. And this from a customer in Salem, Ore.: "Every button, switch and control

is exactly where it should be. My '92 Voyager was great, and I didn't think

much could be done to improve it, but, boy, was I ever wrong. Bravo,

Chrysler."<br><p>

     "I could go on and on about the wonders of the <A HREF="http://www.chryslercars.com/TandC/TandC.htm">

Chrysler Town & Country</A>,"

wrote one customer from Cogan Station, Pa. Michael and Jacqui Ross of Los

Angeles own a <A HREF="http://www.4adodge.com/caravan/caravan.html">

Dodge Grand Caravan</A> ES and a <A HREF="http://www.jeepunpaved.com/grand_cherokee/grand_cherokee.html">Jeep&#174; Grand Cherokee</A> Limited.

"We're in auto heaven," they wrote.<br><p>

     <strong>The <A HREF="http://www.4adodge.com/ram/ram.html">Dodge Ram Pickup</A>

 motivated</strong> numerous letter-writers. "You would not

believe the changes that come over J.R. when driving the Ram. He's like a child

with a new toy," wrote Jody Beadry of Cape Coral, Fla. "On a scale of 10, you

got a 10," wrote Bob and Mary Farley of West Milford, N.J. And according to a

customer from Iowa Park, Texas, "Dodge has engineered a spectacular vehicle,

combining supreme comfort with the look of a real work truck."<br><p>

     And this from a customer in Nitro, W. Va., "I have been saying for 30

years that I would someday buy a pickup. The Ram is absolutely beautiful. Thank

you, Chrysler, for making the finest pickup truck the world has ever seen."<br><p>

     <strong>Jeep vehicles inspired delight.</strong> "Overwhelming satisfaction" led Germany

native Henrik Onne Bodenstab to tell us about three different Jeep vehicles he

has owned. <A HREF="http://www.jeepunpaved.com/wrangler/wrangler.html">Jeep Wrangler

</A> owner Jesse Nash of Lake City, Fla., told us about "a

quarter-million miles of motoring bliss." Sheriff Loren "Squirrel" Carl from

Versailles, Ky., was delighted that one of his deputies took first place in a police pursuit school

by driving a <A HREF="http://www.jeepunpaved.com/cherokee/cherokee.html">Cherokee</A>.

 A Baptist minister from Kenner, La., said, "In a world

where everything is going wrong, it is reassuring to have a vehicle that can

hold up under pressure."<br><p>

    <strong> And, finally, a few words</strong> from our passenger car owners: "This car has

changed my attitude towards driving," wrote <A HREF="http://www.eaglecars.com/viewing/talon/talon.html">

Eagle Talon</A> owner Apryl Nash of

Birmingham, Ala. "I didn't know it was possible to love an automobile until I

bought my <A HREF="http://www.chryslercars.com/Cirrus/Cirrus.htm">Chrysler Cirrus</A>

," said Traci Davis of Texas City, Texas. "Absolutely

vibrant!" wrote <A HREF="http://www.4adodge.com/avenger/avenger.html">Dodge Avenger</A>

 owner Martin Cappa of Indian Head Park, Ill.<br><p>

     A 4' 10 1/2" woman from Walla Walla, Wash., said that she and her 6' 9"

friend both found the <A HREF="http://www.4adodge.com/intrepid/intrepid.html">Dodge Intrepid</A> the most comfortable car they've

experienced. And after his Intrepid topped all competitors at a BMW- sponsored

drivers' school at Watkins Glen International racetrack in New York, a retired

U.S. Marine Corps helicopter pilot summed up his feelings this way: "You done

good, guys."<br>

<a name="comm"><h3>IN THE COMMUNITY: CHRYSLER'S<br>

EMPLOYEES AND DEALERS<br>

GIVE FROM THE HEART</h3></a></center>

<p>

<strong>Shareholder value comes from corporate responsibility.</strong><br>

<p>

     <strong>In so many ways, the people of Chrysler</strong> reached out to lend a helping hand

in 1995.<br><p>

     More than 120 Chrysler Corporation dealerships in 13 markets participated

in "Involved to Solve,TM" tackling nearly 100 community service projects.

Participating dealerships gathered more than 4,100 volunteers who donated more

than 20,500 hours of community service to nonprofit organizations, local

schools or citizens in need. Armed with paintbrushes, shovels, hammers and

generous hearts, volunteers took on projects such as building a wheelchair ramp

at a <A HREF="http://www.salvationarmy.org">Salvation Army</A> homeless

shelter in Phoenix, helping with Oklahoma City's "Heartland Hero Thank You

Celebration," removing graffiti at a local high school in Philadelphia and

painting and refurbishing four homes in Highland Park, Mich.<br><p>

     <strong>Education programs continue to be a focus</strong> of Chrysler's community

involvement efforts. More than 2,000 Chrysler employees participated in the

company's World of Work program, an employee volunteer effort that connects

classroom and workplace learning. Project Work, a collaborative effort with

schools in and near Highland Park, Mich., helps students explore career

opportunities. Project Educator invites teams of teachers and school

administrators to Chrysler facilities monthly to help them update

school-to-work curriculum. Build Your Dream Vehicle challenges high school

students to combine academic knowledge and technical skills to design

environmentally safe, futuristic vehicles. And there are more.<br><p>

     <strong>The Chrysler Corporation Fund contributed</strong> more than ever before to worthy

causes in 1995--nearly $21 million. <A HREF="http://www.bin.com/assocorg/uncf/uncf.htm">The United Negro College Fund</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.ymca.org/otherymca.html">YMCA</A>,

the <A HREF="http://www.unitedway.org/">United Way</A> and numerous colleges and universities were among the

beneficiaries. A special distribution of $5 million provided support for

culture and art groups in southeast Michigan that have been affected by major

funding cutbacks from government sources.<br><p>

     For information on Chrysler's community involvement, write: Chrysler Fund,

<h3><Center>TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS</Center></h3>

<p>

<b>Five years ago, Chrysler was on the rocks--</b>

<br>

short of money, short of products and heading into a 

recession that a lot of people outside and even some inside 

the company weren't sure it would survive.

<p>

     In 1994, we set a company record for U.S. retail sales 

and earned more money--$3.7 billion--than in any other year in 

our history. We became the lowest-cost automaker in the 

world. We fully funded our pension plans. Our credit ratings 

improved again--the best since 1975. We began adding 500,000 

units of manufacturing capacity.  We significantly expanded 

our overseas business. And we ended the year with $7.6 

billion in cash from our automotive operations.

<p>

     From December 1993 to December 1994, our shareholders 

saw the dividends on our common stock increase by 167 

percent. Our dealers had their most profitable year ever. 

Our hourly employees earned the highest profit-sharing 

payouts in the history of the industry. Our suppliers won 

longer-term commitments. 

<p>

     Clearly, we had a great year.

<p>

     <b>HOW WE GOT FROM THERE TO HERE</b> and from then to now is a 

matter of record--outstanding new products, each one a leap 

ahead of the competition, and a relentless attack on waste 

and inefficiency throughout the system.

<p>

     The relevant question now is: Where do we go from here? 

Why invest in Chrysler, work for Chrysler, sell its products 

or become its business partner?

<p>

     In this space a year ago, I outlined the management 

philosophy and the corporate culture that will mold our 

future well into the 21st century. I talked about continuous 

improvement, among other things.

<p>

     Many of you will receive this Annual Report three weeks 

earlier than you did a year ago. A small thing, maybe, but 

our philosophy of continuous improvement is rooted in small 

things. It makes us look at every one of our processes at 

Chrysler, no matter how large or small, and ask: How can we 

do it better, faster or at lower cost?

<p>

     It also challenges us to look at big things. We set 

"stretch" goals in every department, an attempt to improve 

some part of the process by at least 50 percent. Often, we 

fall short, but never without learning or accomplishing 

something. And sometimes we surprise ourselves and overshoot 

our wildest expectations. It's all part of never standing 

still. A lot of short steps and a few giant ones will 

maintain the momentum of the past five years.

<p>

     <b>THIS YEAR'S ANNUAL REPORT</b>, however, is not about our 

philosophy or culture. It's not about the past. And it's not 

about the 21st century. It's focused on the next few years.

<p>

     Everybody today seems mesmerized by the year 2000. It 

has come to symbolize the future. Just about every 

organization (including Chrysler, by the way) has some kind 

of "Project 2000" that in one way or another is supposed to 

help usher in a whole new chunk of history. And yet, 2000 

actually will be the last year of the 20th century, not the 

first year of the 21st. We're all in such a hurry for the 

new millennium that it's easy to forget the challenges yet 

to be met in this one.

<p>

     We don't intend to do that at Chrysler.

<p>

     We've won dozens of awards for fresh, exciting cars and 

trucks. But before the year 2000, we'll replace most of 

them, beginning with the new minivan coming to market this 

spring. The code name for the new minivan is, by the way, 

NS--"never stop." Never stop innovating. Never stop 

improving.

<p>

     Before the year 2000, we'll have to deal with several 

critically important regulatory issues. California, New York 

and Massachusetts, for example, have mandated the sale of 

substantial numbers of electric vehicles by 1998. Developing 

and producing them, although costly, does not represent an 

insurmountable technical problem. We already produce 

electric minivans. The problem is, there is virtually no 

consumer demand for them. So we'll have to price them at 

thousands of dollars below cost in order to generate buyer 

interest and force our other customers to subsidize them 

through higher prices on conventional vehicles. We hope the 

states will repeal their anti-consumer sales mandates.

<p>

     Between now and the year 2000, there will also be new 

efforts to mandate higher gas mileage, in spite of the fact 

that it will have no meaningful impact on global warming or 

the planet's air quality.

<p>

     We have a lot of work to do with the states and with 

Washington in the next five years to help create public 

policies that achieve some rational harmony among society,s 

needs, our customers' needs and the limits of technology.

<p>

     <b>BEFORE THIS DECADE IS OVER</b>, Japan most likely will 

become an even tougher competitor as it comes out of 

recession and adjusts to the higher value of the yen. Our 

products now offer customers significantly more value than 

those of Japanese companies, and we must maintain and even 

expand that advantage.

<p>

     The next five years are likely to see trade barriers 

fall like dominoes all over the world. We must seek new 

overseas opportunities that make sense, without getting 

caught up in the euphoric land rush of international 

expansion newly born of the fall of communism and the 

passage of the recent GATT agreement.

<p>

     The economy is strong and getting stronger going into 

1995, but before the champagne corks pop for the new 

century, there will almost surely be another recession, and 

Chrysler must be prepared for it. We intend to deal with it 

without compromising our product plans or allowing the 

company,s financial position to weaken.

<p>

     These are all challenges that demand our attention now. 

We will produce a product line in the second half of this 

decade every bit as exciting as the one that earned us so 

much acclaim in the first half. And we'll develop world-class power trains to drive them. Finally, we will not rest 

knowing that we're already the industry's lowest-cost 

producer, because we believe there is still a lot of waste 

that can come out. And taking it out will actually improve 

our products and our ability to serve our customers as it 

enhances our bottom line.

<p>

     <b>STRONG PRODUCTS AND A STRONG BALANCE SHEET</b> are the bow 

and stern anchors that will let us ride out the challenges 

we know we'll face in the next five years, as well as the 

ones we can't foresee.

<p>

     The following pages describe our strategies in four key 

areas--product development, technology, supplier relations 

and international operations. We plan to spend approximately 

$23 billion during the remainder of this decade to turn 

those strategies into products and profits.

<p>

     Our stated aim is to become the premier car and truck 

company in the world by the year 2000. So while others are 

looking ahead to the next century, we still have big plans 

for this one.

<h4><Center>A NEW WORLD OF MINIVANS</Center></h3>



<p>

<b>How do you redesign 

the best-selling vehicle 

in Chrysler history?</b>

<p>

     Chrysler invented the minivan in 1983 and has dominated 

the segment ever since, selling more than 4.5 million since 

its inception. Never before has any automaker maintained 

close to a 50 percent share of any major segment for more 

than 10 years. And in just the past five years, Chrysler's 

minivans have also captured more than 20 percent of Europe's 

minivan market. 

<p>

     Today, the U.S. minivan market is a large one, with $25 

billion in annual revenue and more than 20 competing brands. 

Nearly one of every 12 vehicles sold in the United States is 

a minivan. Owner loyalty has been the key to Chrysler's 

success in the market. Three of every four of our minivan 

customers trade in for another Chrysler, Dodge or Plymouth 

minivan.

<p>

     The single most important reason for this success story 

is that our minivans were originally designed from the 

inside out, focusing on the features most demanded by a 

diverse range of customers. Through letters, warranty data 

and consumer research, the voice of our customers has been 

heard and heeded on every detail that might concern them. So 

for the remaking of the Chrysler minivan, our customers' 

input was sought again on everything from seats and storage 

to minute details such as door handle shapes and switch 

locations.

<p>

     The enormous challenge was to improve a product that 

was done right in the first place, one that was copied by 

virtually every competitor. The aim was to set new 

benchmarks, just as the original minivan did 10 years ago. 

We wanted not only to give our customers what they asked 

for, but also to add features and qualities that would 

exceed their requests and surprise and delight them. 



<h4>Staying a step ahead</h4>

<p>

     We invested $2.6 billion in the project--more than in 

any new-vehicle development program in Chrysler history. The 

project included an array of minivan offerings, a new engine 

and redesigned facilities at three assembly plants on two 

continents. From program approval to production, the 800 

members of the company's Minivan Platform Team developed the 

vehicle in just 32 months.

<p>

     The result is a new minivan with breakthrough design 

that is loaded with industry firsts--the first with two 

sliding doors available, patented "Easy Out" roller seats 

and mid-cabin temperature controls, to name a few.

<p>

     By almost any measure--safety, comfort, convenience, 

quietness, performance, efficiency, value--the redesigned 

minivan sets a new benchmark. 

<p>

     It provides a level of ride and handling previously 

enjoyed only in passenger cars. To improve maneuverability, 

the turning circle of both the short- and long-wheelbase 

versions has been reduced by more than three feet. 



<h3>Setting new standards</h3>

<p>

     The new minivan also offers greater driver and front 

passenger visibility, with 30 percent more window glass. 

<p>

     First-for-minivan features include memory seats and 

mirrors and separate driver and passenger temperature 

controls. Cargo storage has been improved. The cupholders 

are also more versatile than ever. The overhead console 

holds more types of sunglasses and garage door openers than 

any other minivan. 

<p>

     The sliding door tracks have been concealed for a more 

pleasing, aero-dynamic look.

<p>

     Ours is the only minivan with available 16-inch wheels 

and tires. The new minivan has the simplest, lightest, most 

compact electronically controlled four-speed automatic 

transaxle in the minivan market.

<p>

     The primary requirement for a minivan, however, is to 

optimize space, and it is here that both the short- and 

long-wheelbase versions of the new Chrysler, Dodge and 

Plymouth vehicles outshine the competition. The company's 

signature cab-forward architecture was once again applied to 

accomplish this task, as well as to define a new, pure, 

aerodynamic minivan shape. 



<h3>More room than ever</h3>

<p>

     The result is a more spacious vehicle. Cargo room was 

increased by 27 percent on the long-wheelbase minivan and 25 

percent on the short-wheelbase model. The short-wheelbase 

version is 3.6 inches shorter on the outside than a Mercury 

Villager but provides 13 percent more cargo space. In fact, 

the new Chrysler short-wheelbase versions are nearly 15 

inches shorter than the long-wheelbase Ford Windstar yet 

exceed Windstar's cargo space. And the long-wheelbase 

version is 1.6 inches shorter than the Windstar but has 18 

percent more maximum cargo space.



<h3>Something for everyone</h3>

<p>

     Chrysler's minivan lineup is the most wide-ranging in 

the industry, covering three brands, four price classes, 

short- and long-wheelbase, three- and four-door models and a 

choice of four engines, plus a turbo-diesel for 

international markets. For the first time, a short-wheelbase 

version of the Chrysler Town & Country luxury minivan is 

available.

<p>

     Chrysler's minivans will continue to be the company's 

leading alternative-power vehicles, with compressed natural 

gas and electric versions available. 

<p>

     We will have the capacity to build more than 700,000 

minivans a year in three assembly plants by 1996, with the 

flexibility to build both long- and short-wheelbase models 

at each plant. Minivans for the North American market are 

assembled in St. Louis, Mo., and Windsor, Ontario. Minivans 

for international markets are assembled in Graz, Austria. 





<h3>Still the safety leader</h3>

<p>

     From the start, Chrysler has been the safety leader in 

minivans. And, through a series of improvements, it has 

remained so. In 1991, Chrysler introduced air bags on 

minivans. In 1992, Chrysler pioneered the integrated child 

safety seat. In 1994, Chrysler minivans met all 1998 

passenger car safety standards. Safety leadership continues 

with the new minivan. Four-wheel antilock brakes are 

standard on all 1996 minivan models, as are driver and 

passenger air bags.
<p>

     New safety details include a sliding-door hold-open 

latch with child guard locks and new nonglare interior 

lighting. A windshield wiper de-icer at the base of the 

windshield has been added, providing greater visibility on 

icy days. 

<p>

     On many models, head restraints are available on all 

outboard seating positions. Adjustable turning loops on seat 

belts in the first and second rows of seats for greater seat 

belt comfort and effectiveness are standard on all models. 

The integrated child safety seat has also been refined to 

include a multi-position reclining seatback. 

<p>

     A security alarm option, keyless entry with panic 

button, greater driver and passenger command-of-the-road 

visibility and stable, predictable handling under a variety 

of road and weather conditions also enhance the feeling of 

safety and security. It all adds up to safety leadership for 

a new generation of minivans.

<h4><Center>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</Center></h4>





<p>

<b>Our product pledge:

To surprise and delight</b>

<p>

     How do customers measure the quality of a vehicle? They 

evaluate its reliability, durability and value--and they rate 

the sales and service experience. Chrysler has made giant 

strides in each of these areas in recent years, but so has 

every auto manufacturer throughout the world. Reliability 

and fit and finish have ceased to be differentiators. Today, 

technology--in the form of multivalve high-performance 

engines, sophisticated four-wheel independent suspension 

packages and antilock braking systems--has become so 

uniformly excellent that it's hard to argue anymore that any 

company has a technological edge.

<p>

     So how does an automaker distinguish itself from 

its competitors?



<h4>The ingredients of the Chrysler mix</h4>

<p>

     Part of the Chrysler product philosophy is that it 

takes more than an absence of negatives to define a top-quality product. There must be positive reasons to buy. 

Here's how we try to set our vehicles apart in the 

marketplace:

<p>

<ul>

<li><b>Great design</b>--Style is critical. That includes not 

only the exterior of the vehicle, but also how the 

components of the vehicle are "packaged" for the customer. 

Leading-edge design has become a Chrysler hallmark. We 

pioneered cab-forward design to create a contemporary, 

aerodynamic look while giving more interior space back to 

the driver and passengers.

<p>

<li><b>Fun to drive</b>--A key component in the Chrysler mix is a 

sense of "oneness" in the ride, handling and performance of 

the vehicle. We try to inject driver involvement in our 

vehicles. We know we have achieved this objective when our 

owners tell us, "I don't know exactly what it is about my 

car, but I really love to drive it." 

<p>

<li><b>Safety</b>--Our philosophy is not to wait for new 

standards to be set, but to be aggressive in pioneering new 

safety functions with the right balance of active 

and passive features. 

<p>

<li><b>Value</b>--We don't believe the world is getting richer 

and that people just want more high-tech and more expensive 

cars. We aim to meet customer needs at less cost than the 

competition and to surprise our customers with extra 

features that they don't expect. We also provide value 

through our "one size up" philosophy--providing the interior 

size of a compact in the body of a subcompact, or full-size 

space in a mid-size car.

</ul>



<h4>Refining our product development process</h4>

<p>

     In the last five years, we've made radical changes in 

how we develop new products. By organizing designers, 

engineers, suppliers and specialists in purchasing, 

manufacturing, product planning, finance and marketing into 

platform teams, we've reduced the time it takes to develop a 

vehicle from five to significantly less than three years--and 

two-and-a-half years is in sight.

<p>

     There have been other changes, too. Determining new-product investment once was driven by the Finance group, but 

target-based costing has shifted ownership of that process 

to the platform teams. Finance is now a valued business 

partner that helps the teams make accurate, sound decisions. 

Computer-aided design and rapid prototyping are also helping 

us refine and shorten our process.



<h4>'Right brain' at work</h4>

<p>

     At Chrysler, we believe "right-brain" creative thinking 

has a big place in the auto business, especially in 

designing the look and feel of a vehicle. This business is 

not a pure science. It's a combination of science and art. 

<p>

     We view research as directional, not absolute. We 

believe this approach has served us better than a singular 

focus on market data. 

<p>

     We will continue to employ a "leapfrog" strategy in all 

market segments. That means continually aiming to reinvent 

vehicles that will delight our customers. The next time we 

develop a new series of cars or trucks, they may or may not 

be the same size as they are today. They may or may not have 

the same name or characteristics. But we promise they won,t 

be boring. They'll be distinctive, different and fun to 

drive. 

<p>

     That's our product pledge.

<h3><Center>TECHNOLOGY</Center></h3>





<p>

<b>Stimulating innovation

through centers of excellence</b>

<p>

     At Chrysler, research and development isn't delegated 

to a group of specialists locked away in some remote 

laboratory. Instead, it extends throughout the corporation. 

For example:



<ul>

<p>

<li>Neon Lite, an experimental vehicle using aluminum, 

magnesium and composite lightweight materials, was developed 

by engineers on Chrysler's Small Car Platform Team. The test 

project removed 600 pounds from the already-light Dodge and 

Plymouth Neon.

<p>

<li>Patriot is Chrysler's "laboratory on wheels" to test 

hybrid power plants. It's powered by a system of twin-turbine turbo-alternators running on liquified natural gas, 

an energy-storing flywheel and an electric traction motor. 

If the technology proves successful, the Patriot may be 

entered in selected World Sports Car endurance races in 

1995. 

<p>

<li>A national UAW/Chrysler Product Quality Improvement 

Partnership waste elimination team was formed in 1994 to 

address the goal of waste-free Chrysler facilities by the 

year 2000.

<p>

<li>Chrysler,s Liberty and Technical Affairs group, a 

small advance development team, identifies and explores new 

processes and vehicle components for adoption by platform 

teams.

<p>

<li>Chrysler engineers are testing fully recycled and 

remanufactured antifreeze for possible use in future 

projects.

<p>

<li>A record 134 employee innovators were honored in 1994 

by Chrysler as patent award winners.



<h3>Collaborative initiatives add value</h3>

<p>

<li>Chrysler is working with Ford Motor Co., General 

Motors Corp. and the U.S. government on a project to develop 

in 10 years a practical, affordable car that gets up to 80 

miles per gallon. 

<p>

<li>A partnership with the University of Michigan is 

studying the use of virtual reality in the design of 

vehicles. Since 1985, Chrysler has tapped university 

resources through a challenge fund that has resulted in 95 

projects at 29 institutions. 

<p>
<li>Chrysler and National Rubber Company Inc. are working 

to make vehicle parts out of recycled tire rubber.

<p>

<li>	The United States Council on Automotive Research, 

USCAR, established in 1992 by Chrysler, Ford and General 

Motors to coordinate a growing number of pre-competitive 

research projects, now has 14 partnerships. One three-year 

study found ways to get vehicle computer systems to process 

information more efficiently. Another three-year partnership 

was formed in 1994 to develop supercomputer software for 

designing vehicles. Another aims to reduce the cost of 

natural gas storage tanks by 50 percent within four years. 

Other efforts focus on low-emission technology, vehicle 

recycling, composite materials and batteries for electric 

vehicles. 

<p>

<li>Our Kenosha (Wis.) Engine Plant worked with its local 

gas company to convert the plant's forklift trucks to 

compressed natural gas, contributing to cleaner air, cost 

savings and faster, safer refueling.

</ul>

<p>

     Chrysler's approach to research is to tap a diversity 

of technological expertise in our platform teams and plants, 

in supplier companies and universities, and in partnerships 

with government and industry. Most of these efforts are 

devoted to research focused on responding to current and 

future regulations, vehicle quality and reliability, 

manufacturability and on new ways to increase the speed of 

our processes. 



<h3>Research driven by future needs</h3>

<p>

     In recent years, new technology and facilities have 

aided our research. A computer system known as CATIA enables 

employees and suppliers to tap into a common database that 

Chrysler uses to develop new products, including plant 

layouts and service manuals. Stereolithography and other 

rapid prototyping tools have slashed the time to develop a 

component for testing. At the Chrysler Technology Center, a 

pilot plant, an evaluation road and 424,000 square feet of 

scientific test facilities simulate real-world operating 

conditions and help to ensure product quality, reliability, 

durability and regulatory compliance. And at our Chelsea 

(Mich.) Proving Grounds, a new automated durability road 

will be completed in 1995 that will allow us to test 

vehicles in conditions too severe for drivers. 

<p>

     To manage our research, a technology council helps us 

promote and prioritize technology initiatives and eases 

transfer to production applications.

<p>

     This decentralized approach taps abundant, widespread 

resources for maximum benefit, making full use of all 

partners, contributions.

<h3><Center>SUPPLIER RELATIONS</Center></h3>



<p>

<b>Chrysler's Extended Enterprise:<br>

More than an American keiretsu</b>

<p>

     Materials purchased from suppliers represent the 

largest single cost factor in the price of a car, which 

makes managing the supply base an important strategy. 

Previous methods of working with suppliers often included 

demands for cost cuts, which generated little loyalty, or a 

"lowest-bidder-wins" approach, which inhibited long-term 

relationships. In Japan, the keiretsu, in which an automaker 

has ownership interest or management control of its 

suppliers, has been more successful.

<p>

     At Chrysler, we are creating relationships with our 

suppliers that provide closeness without control. We call 

this approach our "Extended Enterprise." This process unites 

and extends business relationships through supplier tiers to 

maximize the effectiveness of our vehicle development and 

minimize our costs.

<p>

     Three years ago, changes in our relations with 

suppliers began to take form through our Supplier Cost 

Reduction Effort, or SCORE program. SCORE was conceived as a 

communications program as well as a savings program--a way 

for suppliers to help us eliminate waste in our processes 

and theirs. Over the last three years, we,ve received more 

than 9,700 ideas from suppliers, worth more than $1.1 

billion in savings. In the 1994 model year alone, more than 

$500 million of savings were achieved. The target for 1995 

is $750 million. About half of the supplier ideas we receive 

are implemented. The goal is to reduce cost and waste, not 

supplier profit margins. The best ideas are shared, which 

leads to more ideas. 



<h3>The changing role of a Chrysler supplier</h3>

<p>

     Participation in SCORE is expected of Chrysler 

suppliers. We also want our suppliers to have other 

customers, which helps them become our windows to the world. 

We expect our suppliers to be sources of new technology and 

to be experts in the components they produce. We expect our 

suppliers to be profitable on Chrysler business and to 

reinvest those profits in new technology in support of our 

efforts to continually improve our products. 

<p>

     We've changed the way we do business with our 

suppliers. We're now selecting suppliers for parts even 

before the parts are designed. We're encouraging suppliers 

to add engineers for their new role and to convert sales 

staffs into program managers. 

<p>

     Communication with our production suppliers is mostly 

electronic, allowing for instant information exchange. This 

builds teamwork and helps with capacity planning. We're 

sharing our product plan more openly with our key suppliers. 

Some are doing joint research with us. We participate in 

process redesign studies together.

<p>

     The new, closer relationships have allowed us to reduce 

parts inventories. On some components, inventories are now 

measured in hours rather than days. We have a more dedicated 

supply base now. As we enter new markets, we will begin to 

take our key suppliers with us. 

<p>

     We're reducing our number of first-tier suppliers in 

all areas. We've gone from 300 fastener suppliers to 142, 

with plans to reach 42. For major commodities, we have even 

fewer suppliers. We've gone from 14 wiring suppliers, seven 

tire suppliers and five paint suppliers to two in each 

category. Fewer suppliers means better focus, closer ties, 

more dedicated resources and longer commitments to Chrysler. 


<h3>Fewer but closer relationships</h3>
<p>

     We're aiming for a total of 150 first-tier production 

suppliers. We have about 1,250 now, but 90 percent of our 

business is done with 150 of them. Some of our first-tier 

suppliers are becoming second-tier or subsuppliers, which 

encourages all of our suppliers to work closely with each 

other. We will help manage that process through consulting, 

not through purchase orders. The Chrysler Extended 

Enterprise also means joint management of second- and third-tier suppliers. There is now closer, faster communication 

across the entire supply base, with our goal being to unify 

all levels of suppliers to work together on Chrysler 

projects.

<p>

     We make a special effort to develop our business with 

minority suppliers and encourage our suppliers to do the 

same. Toward that goal, we publish a Minority Supplier 

Profiles directory and establish measurable minority 

procurement goals. In recognition of these efforts, the 

Michigan Minority Business Development Council named 

Chrysler its Corporation of the Year for 1994.

<p>

     We aim to develop relationships that make us our 

suppliers' best customer. And we aim to make each supplier 

as valuable to our team as possible. In the end, the winner 

will be our customers.

<h3><Center>AROUND THE WORLD</Center></h3>



<p>

<b>We,re exploring select,

sensible opportunities to support 

our core market</b>



<p>

     For Chrysler, 1994 was an active year in world markets. 

We began producing Jeep&#174; Grand Cherokees in Austria and 

introduced our Neon subcompacts and Vision mid-size sedans 

to Europe. We opened regional sales offices in Milan and 

Vienna and appointed distributors and dealers in Poland, 

Russia and Kazakhstan. We broke ground for a new parts 

warehouse in Belgium and announced that the Netherlands 

would be the site of a future European corporate office. 

Since we reentered the European market in 1987, we,ve sold 

more than 300,000 vehicles there. 

<p>

     We also began selling right-hand-drive Jeep Cherokees 

in Australia in 1994, and we set a yearly sales record with 

more than 10,000 right-hand-drive Cherokees in Japan.  In 

Taiwan, the Chrysler Concorde was named Car of the Year, and 

Neon become that country's second-highest-selling import 

car. 

<p>

     An international panel of auto writers elected the Neon 

its World Car 1994. 

<p>

     Our appearance at the Sao Paulo (Brazil) Auto Show set 

the stage for our future growth in South America.  And 

Chrysler products received rave reviews at auto shows and 

expositions in South Africa and Vietnam. 

<p>

     Our international shipments, including vehicle kits 

delivered for assembly, topped 160,000 units in 1994. We're 

targeting international shipments of 300,000 units a year by 

the end of the decade. In the next few years, we expect to 

be selling right-hand-drive versions of our minivans, Neon 

and Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee. 



<h3>Taking a different approach</h3>

<p>

     Conventional wisdom said that customers around the 

world are so distinct that products had to be designed 

specifically for each market. Another notion was that 

automakers had to sell a large volume in a market to make a 

profit.

<p>

     Chrysler's approach to international markets challenges 

those beliefs. We believe the world's automotive tastes are 

converging. We view ourselves as primarily a North American 

producer of vehicles that are designed for the world. We 

pursue world markets, but only those that make sense for 

Chrysler and support our core business. 

<p>

     That our products are more international in character 

than ever before is an advantage for us. We also believe 

that working on products for the world in a single location 

reduces waste and improves efficiency. Our vehicle 

development platform teams are addressing international 

requirements at the earliest stages of product development. 

An added benefit to this approach is that exposure to 

international markets strengthens our people. And the better 

our people can meet international customer requirements, the 

more refined our products will be in North America. 

<p>

     So far, we have been building on the worldwide appeal 

of our minivans and Jeep&#174; vehicles. For future growth, we 

hope to become more of a full-line, small-volume marketer, 

mainly through exports instead of through overseas 

manufacturing. 



<h3>Opportunities for growth</h3>

<p>

     China has attractive long-term potential as an auto 

market. We have several opportunities there with potential 

investments ranging from $100 million to $1 billion. 

However, as with most international market opportunities, we 

expect these projects to develop slowly, and we don,t expect 

all of them to work out. If they don't make good business 

sense for us, we'll walk away from them.

<p>

     Southeast Asia, India and South Africa are other areas 

of opportunity. Japan offers the largest potential for immediate market growth, and with its expanding economy, Latin 

America is another potential growth area.

<p>

<b>Employees, dealers working to be part of the solution

</b>

<p>

     How can we help? That's a question Chrysler employees and 

dealers both ask and answer. Through generous contributions 

to the United Way and by getting involved in their 

communities, the people of Chrysler addressed a variety of 

needs in 1994. Here's a sample:



<h4>Dealers get 'Involved to Solve'</h4>

<p>

     Chrysler/Plymouth, Dodge and Jeep&#174;/Eagle dealers across 

the United States asked Chrysler Corporation for support 

tailored to local community needs. Chrysler responded in 

1994 with Involved to Solve--a pilot program to provide a 

framework for coordinating dealers' community projects

<p>

     Involved to Solve was tested in four communities. 

Dealers teamed with community leaders to identify projects 

to help nonprofit organizations, schools or citizens in 

need. Once the needs were identified, the dealers led 

donation and volunteer drives. 

<p>

     In Los Angeles, dealers worked with the mayor and 

police chief to roll out Operation Sparkle, a citywide 

cleanup drive. In Phoenix, more than 400 volunteers 

completed 14 Involved to Solve projects on one Saturday 

morning. Employees in Chrysler's Phoenix Zone Office pitched 

in by building a reading room for children at a Salvation 

Army facility. Charlotte (N.C.) dealers landscaped and 

painted community schools, while dealers in the Chicago area 

tackled projects for local nonprofit agencies.

<p>

     The U.S. education system remains a focal point of 

Chrysler's community efforts. 

<ul>

<li>Through Chrysler's World of Work program, 3,000 

company and dealership employees volunteer to help students 

prepare for the workplace and life in the 21st century. 

<p>

<li>The Chrysler Learning Connection reaches every 

public, private and parochial school in the United States 

with materials to involve families in reading. 

<p>

<li>More than 200,000 children in 411 schools in every 

major Chrysler plant city have participated in the Running 

Start reading motivation program. Working with Reading Is 

Fundamental, we've distributed more than a million books in 

the process.



<h4>Our growing partnership with schools</h4>

<p>

<li>To encourage families to use their local libraries, 

Chrysler sponsors the Rev Up to Read family reading program, 

a joint effort with WJBK-TV-Detroit and the Southeastern 

Michigan Libraries, reaching 5,000 students. 

<p>

<li>A Speakers Bureau also taps the experience of 

Chrysler employees, who talk to educational groups about the 

skills needed for the workplace of the future. 

</ul>



<h4>Chrysler Fund doubles its reach</h4>

<p>

     Because we want to include the community in Chrysler's 

success, the Chrysler Corporation Fund made charitable 

contributions of $16.6 million in 1994--a 100-percent 

increase over the previous year. The donations included the 

Fund's largest-ever individual grant program--more than $4.3 

million in support of 19 southeast Michigan cultural and 

artistic organizations, including $1 million contributions 

to the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Detroit Symphony 

Orchestra. The Fund also donated more than $1 million to the 

Running Start reading program and awarded 101 college 

scholarships to sons and daughters of Chrysler employees in 

1994. Since it was founded in 1953, the Chrysler Fund has 

distributed more than $150 million in charitable grants to 

organizations throughout the United States.

<CENTER><h3>CHRYSLER CORPORATION</h3></CENTER>

<BR>

<P>

<h3><CENTER><A NAME="004">GENERAL</A></CENTER></h3>

<P>

     Chrysler Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of

Delaware on March 4, 1986, and is the surviving corporation following mergers

with a number of its operating subsidiaries, including Chrysler Motors

Corporation which was originally incorporated in 1925.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Chrysler")

operate in two principal industry segments: automotive operations and financial

services. Automotive operations include the research, design, manufacture,

assembly and sale of cars, trucks and related parts and accessories. Financial

services include the operations of Chrysler Financial Corporation and its

consolidated subsidiaries ("CFC"), which are engaged principally in providing

consumer and dealer automotive financing for Chrysler's products. Chrysler also

participates in short-term vehicle rental activities through certain of its

subsidiaries (the "Car Rental Operations") and engages in aircraft modification

and the manufacture of electronics products and systems through its Chrysler

Technologies Corporation subsidiary. Chrysler's principal executive offices are

located at Chrysler World Headquarters, 1000 Chrysler Drive, Auburn Hills,

Michigan 48326-2766. The telephone number of those offices is (810)

576-5741.

<BR>

<P>

<h3><CENTER><A NAME="005">AUTOMOTIVE OPERATIONS</A></CENTER></h3>

<P>

     Chrysler manufactures, assembles and sells cars and trucks under the

brand names Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Eagle and Jeep(R), and related automotive

parts and accessories, primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico ("North

America"). Passenger cars are offered in various size classes and models.

Chrysler produces trucks in pickup, sport-utility and van/wagon models, which

constitute the largest segments of the truck market. Chrysler also purchases and

distributes certain passenger cars manufactured in Japan by Mitsubishi Motors

Corporation ("MMC"), as well as cars manufactured in the United States by MMC's

subsidiary, Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing of America ("MMMA"), formerly

Diamond-Star Motors Corporation.

<BR>

<P>

     Although Chrysler currently sells most of its vehicles in the United

States, Canada and Mexico, Chrysler also participates in other international

markets through its subsidiaries, Chrysler Motors de Venezuela, S.A., Chrysler

Japan Sales Limited ("CJSL"), Chrysler do Brasil Comercial Exportadora

Importadora Ltda., and Chrysler Sales & Services (Thailand) Ltd., and indirectly

through its minority investments in Beijing Jeep Corporation, Ltd. and Arab

American Vehicles Company. Chrysler sells to independent distributors in Europe

and other world markets vehicles which are produced in North America by Chrysler

and in Austria by Eurostar Automobilwerk Ges.mb.H & Co. KG ("Eurostar"), a joint

venture between Chrysler and Steyr-Daimler-Puch Fahrzeugtechnik ("Steyr") in

Graz, Austria.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's strategy is to focus on its core automotive business. As

part of this strategy, Chrysler has sold certain assets and businesses which are

not related to its core automotive business, and is exploring the sale of other

such assets and businesses in the near term.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="006">The Automotive Industry in North America</A></strong>

<P>

     The automotive industry in North America is highly competitive with

respect to a number of factors, including vehicle quality, price, development

and introduction time, appearance, size, special options, distribution

organization, warranties, reliability, safety, fuel economy, dealer service and

financing terms. As a result, Chrysler's ability to increase vehicle prices and

to use retail sales incentives effectively are significantly affected by the

pricing actions and sales programs of its principal competitors. Moreover, the

introduction of new products by other manufacturers may adversely affect the

market shares of competing products made by

Chrysler. Recently, Chrysler has been very successful in bringing new products

to market, in greatly reduced vehicle development time. However, many of

Chrysler's competitors have larger worldwide sales volumes and greater financial

resources, which may, over time, place Chrysler at a competitive disadvantage in

responding to new competitor offerings, substantial changes in consumer

preferences, governmental regulations, or adverse economic conditions in North

America.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's long-term profitability will depend significantly on its

ability to continue its capital expenditure and vehicle development programs and

market its products successfully. The success of Chrysler's new vehicles will

depend on a number of factors, including general economic conditions,

competition, consumer acceptance, product quality, new product development, the

effect of governmental regulation and the strength of Chrysler's marketing and

dealer networks. As both Chrysler and its competitors plan to introduce new

products, Chrysler cannot predict the market shares its new products will

achieve. Moreover, Chrysler is substantially committed to its product plans and

would be adversely affected by events requiring a major shift in product

development.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's principal competitors in North America are General Motors

Corporation and Ford Motor Company. In addition, a number of foreign automotive

companies own and operate manufacturing and/or assembly facilities in North

America ("transplants"), and there are a number of other foreign manufacturers

that distribute automobiles and light-duty trucks in North America.

(1) All U.S. retail sales data are based on publicly available

            information on manufacturers from the American Automobile

            Manufacturers Association and data on foreign company imports from

            Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication.

<BR>

<P>

(2) "Foreign-Based Manufacturers" include imports and vehicles assembled

            and sold in the United States by foreign companies.

<BR>

<P>

(3) U.S. truck retail market share includes minivans.

<BR>

<P>

     Competition from foreign car and truck manufacturers, in the form of

both exports to the United States and sales by transplants, is substantial. The

market share for foreign passenger cars sold in the United States (including

transplants) was 36.3 percent in 1995, compared to 35.4 percent in 1994. The

market share for foreign trucks sold in the United States (including

transplants) was 14.9 percent in 1995, compared to 15.3 percent in 1994.

Vehicles assembled in the United States by Japanese manufacturers have

significantly contributed to the market share obtained by foreign-based

manufacturers. Japanese transplant sales accounted for approximately 18.5

percent of the U.S. passenger car market and 5.3 percent of the U.S. truck

market in 1995, compared to 16.1 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively, in

1994.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="008">Chrysler Canada Ltd.</A></strong>

<P>

     Chrysler's consolidated subsidiary, Chrysler Canada Ltd. ("Chrysler

Canada"), operates manufacturing and assembly facilities and sales and

distribution networks in Canada. Chrysler Canada, whose operations are

substantially integrated with Chrysler's U.S. operations, manufactures

components and assembles minivans, mid-size and large sedans, and full-size

vans.

<BR>

<P>

     In 1995 and 1994, Chrysler Canada shipped 540,493 and 692,615 vehicles,

respectively, the majority of which were sold outside of Canada. Chrysler

Canada's retail sales totaled 225,122 vehicles in 1995 and 247,752 vehicles in

1994, the majority of which were manufactured outside of Canada. Chrysler

Canada's retail unit sales of cars accounted for 14.6 percent and 15.7 percent

of the Canadian car market in 1995 and 1994, respectively. In 1995, retail unit

sales of trucks accounted for 25.8 percent of the Canadian truck market compared

with 25.7 percent in 1994. In 1995, Chrysler Canada ranked third in the Canadian

industry in retail unit sales of both cars and trucks.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="009">Chrysler de Mexico S.A.</A></strong>

<P>

     Chrysler's consolidated subsidiary, Chrysler de Mexico S.A. ("Chrysler

Mexico"), operates assembly and manufacturing facilities in Mexico, producing

vehicles and components for both Mexican and export markets. In addition,

Chrysler Mexico provides certain major automobile components to Chrysler,

including engines and air conditioning condensers.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler Mexico manufactured 207,004 vehicles in 1995 and 238,888

vehicles in 1994. Of these totals, 26,503 vehicles and 77,832 vehicles were sold

in Mexico in 1995 and 1994, respectively. Sales of vehicles exported to Mexico

were not significant in 1995 or 1994. The decrease in vehicles manufactured and

sold in Mexico was primarily attributable to unfavorable economic conditions in

Mexico, commencing with the devaluation of the Mexican peso in December 1994.

Chrysler's operating results will continue to be adversely affected to the

extent that the unfavorable economic conditions in Mexico continue.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler Mexico's vehicle sales accounted for 14.6 percent of the

Mexican wholesale car market and 16.9 percent of the Mexican wholesale truck

market in 1995, compared with 13.1 percent and 19.4 percent, respectively, in

1994. Within the Mexican industry, Chrysler Mexico's wholesale unit sales ranked

fourth in both cars and trucks in 1995. In 1995, overall wholesale industry

sales in Mexico are estimated to have been approximately 235,500 units, compared

with 620,000 units in 1994, a decrease of 62.0 percent. Although Chrysler

expects the economic conditions in Mexico to improve slightly in 1996, Chrysler

cannot predict when the Mexican automotive industry sales will return to

predevaluation levels.

<strong><A NAME="010">International Operations</A></strong>

<P>

     Chrysler's automotive operations in Europe consist primarily of

manufacturing operations in Austria, where Jeep Grand Cherokees and Chrysler

Voyagers are produced, and the export of finished vehicles and

component kits produced in North America to independent foreign distributors and

local manufacturers. In addition, Chrysler opened a parts distribution center in

1995 and will open a European Headquarters Office in Brussels, Belgium in

1996.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's Latin American operations include an assembly facility in

Venezuela. During 1995, Chrysler established wholly owned distribution companies

in Brazil and Argentina and announced its intent to establish a manufacturing

facility in Argentina to produce vehicles for sale in South America. Production

of the Chrysler Neon will begin in Venezuela in 1996 and the Jeep Grand Cherokee

will be produced in Argentina beginning in 1997.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's automotive operations in Asia consist of both manufacturing

and assembly of Jeep vehicles in Beijing, China and assembly of component kits

in Malaysia and Indonesia. During 1995, Chrysler expanded its presence in Asia

by purchasing a majority interest in its Japanese distributor (CJSL), opening a

parts distribution center in Singapore and entering into a joint-venture in

Thailand to sell Chrysler products. In addition, Chrysler received a license to

build a plant in Vietnam, where assembly of Dakota pickup trucks is anticipated.

Chrysler also has an equity interest in a company with manufacturing and

assembly facilities in Egypt.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler expects to continue to focus on growth opportunities in major

markets such as Western Europe, Japan and China and will explore developing

markets in South America, Eastern Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. New

manufacturing and joint venture operations could be established if market

conditions, sales levels and profitability opportunities are consistent with

Chrysler's corporate objectives.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's expansion strategy in international markets includes

integrating international and North American product development which enables

Chrysler to make European and right-hand-drive versions available overseas

shortly after left-hand-drive versions debut in the U.S. During 1995,

right-hand-drive and diesel engine options have been added to many product lines

to enhance product acceptance and growth opportunities in international markets.

By the end of 1996, five right-hand-drive models (Chrysler Neon, Chrysler

Voyager and Jeep Cherokee, Grand Cherokee and Wrangler) will be available in

certain markets, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and

Japan.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler shipped 168,860 vehicles to international markets in 1995, an

increase of 23 percent from 1994. Chrysler sold 90,016 units in European markets

and 78,844 units in other world markets, primarily Japan, Taiwan and the Middle

East. In addition, Chrysler exported 40,892 kits to worldwide affiliates for

assembly in 1995, compared to 24,272 kits in 1994. The majority of the kits were

Jeep products shipped to China, Indonesia and Venezuela.

<BR>

<P>

     Eurostar sold 37,063 minivans in 1995, compared to 38,830 in 1994. The

decline in minivan sales was primarily attributable to the launch of Chrysler's

all-new minivans at the Graz, Austria assembly plant in the third quarter of

1995. In addition, Chrysler, under an assembly agreement with Steyr, began

production of Jeep Grand Cherokees in Austria during the fourth quarter of 1994

for European and other world markets.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler presently does not have significant risks related to changes

in currency exchange rates as Chrysler is primarily a North American automotive

company. Chrysler does, however, have international component sourcing and

growing international sales. When Chrysler sells vehicles outside the United

States or purchases components from suppliers outside the United States,

transactions are frequently denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.

The primary foreign currencies in which Chrysler has activities are the German

mark, French franc, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Taiwan dollar,

Austrian schilling and British pound. To the extent possible, receipts and

disbursements in a specific currency are offset against each other. In addition,

Chrysler periodically initiates hedging activities by entering into currency

exchange agreements, consisting primarily of currency forward contracts and

purchased currency options, to minimize revenue and cost variations which could

result from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Chrysler also

utilizes written currency options to effectively close out existing purchased

currency options. At December 31, 1995, Chrysler had currency exchange

agreements for the German mark, French franc, Japanese yen and British pound.

Chrysler's operating results are affected by changes in currency exchange rates

during the period in which transactions are executed, to the extent that hedge

coverage does not exist. However, the impact of any changes in currency exchange

rates on unhedged transactions is not expected to be material to Chrysler's

operating results or financial position.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler does not use derivative financial instruments for trading

purposes. Chrysler's hedging activities are based upon purchases and sales which

are exposed to foreign currency risk. The currency exchange agreements which

provide hedge coverage typically mature within two years of origination,

consistent with the underlying purchase or sales commitment. These hedging

instruments are periodically modified as existing commitments are fulfilled and

new commitments are made. Chrysler's management believes that its hedging

activities have been effective in reducing Chrysler's limited risks related to

currency exchange fluctuations.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="011">Mitsubishi Motors Corporation</A></strong>

<P>

     Under the terms of the United States Distribution Agreement ("USDA") in

effect between Chrysler and MMC, which terminates in March 1998, Chrysler

imports and distributes selected models of passenger cars manufactured by MMC in

Japan. In 1995, Chrysler sold 14,823 MMC-manufactured vehicles in the United

States, representing less than one percent of Chrysler's U.S. retail vehicle

sales. In 1994, Chrysler sold 28,849 MMC-manufactured vehicles in the United

States, representing slightly more than one percent of Chrysler's U.S. retail

vehicle sales. An agreement similar to the USDA is in effect covering the

Canadian market. Chrysler's imported vehicles have posted relatively low sales

in recent years. As a result, during 1996, Chrysler and MMC plan to consider an

early termination of the existing USDA.

<BR>

<P>

     In addition to passenger cars, Chrysler purchases 2.5-liter and

3.0-liter V-6 engines from MMC for use in the production of certain minivans and

other vehicles. Chrysler purchased approximately 372,000 such engines during

1995. MMMA produces small sporty cars in the United States for Chrysler and

Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America. Pursuant to a distribution agreement that

terminates in July 1999, Chrysler retains the right to purchase vehicles up to a

specific maximum allocation that has been agreed to by the parties for each

model year.

<BR>

<P>

     In addition, Chrysler will provide engines and transmissions for use in

certain MMMA vehicles. Chrysler's sales of MMMA-manufactured vehicles in 1995

and 1994 represented 3.7 and 1.7 percent, respectively, of Chrysler's U.S.

retail vehicle sales volume in each period. Chrysler does not anticipate any

major changes to its MMMA distribution agreement during 1996.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler previously owned an equity interest in both MMC and MMMA.

Chrysler sold its 50 percent interest in MMMA to MMC, its partner in the joint

venture, in October 1991. Chrysler subsequently sold its equity interest in MMC

in 1992 and 1993.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="012">Segment Information</A></strong>

<P>

     Industry segment and geographic area data for 1995, 1994 and 1993 are

summarized in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note

17.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="013">Seasonal Nature of Business</A></strong>

<P>

     Reflecting retail sales fluctuations of a seasonal nature, production

varies from month to month in the automotive business. In addition, the

changeover period related to model year introductions has traditionally

occurred in the third quarter of each year. Accordingly, third quarter operating

results are generally less favorable than those in the other quarters of the

year.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="014">Automotive Product Plans</A></strong>

<P>

     Chrysler's automotive design and development activities are organized

into cross-functional product development groups called "platform teams." The

platform team system is designed to improve communications, reduce the design

and development time of new vehicles, improve product quality, and reduce the

cost of developing new vehicle lines. The platform team concept has contributed

significantly to Chrysler's success in recent years.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler introduced an all-new compact car marketed as the Chrysler

Cirrus in the third quarter of 1994. The Cirrus offers newly designed engines,

includes driver and passenger airbags, and utilizes Chrysler's "cab-forward"

design. The Cirrus received the Motor Trend Car of the Year Award in 1995. A

Dodge version of the vehicle, the Dodge Stratus, was introduced in the first

quarter of 1995. In addition, a Plymouth version of the vehicle, the Plymouth

Breeze, was added in the 1996 model year.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler added the Dodge Avenger in the third quarter of 1994 and

introduced the Chrysler Sebring in the first quarter of 1995. These two-door

coupes compete in the mid-specialty segment and are built exclusively for

Chrysler by MMMA.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler introduced its all-new minivan in the first quarter of 1995.

The new Chrysler Town & Country, Dodge Caravan, and Plymouth Voyager provide

many unique product features, including a driver's side sliding door. Despite

its classification as a truck, the Dodge Caravan was named the Motor Trend Car

of the Year in 1996. Chrysler held 42.1 percent and 43.4 percent of the U.S.

minivan segment in 1995 and 1994, respectively. In spite of increased

competition in this segment and reduced availability due to model changeover,

retail sales of Chrysler minivans in the United States were 493,997 in 1995,

compared to 513,163 in 1994.

<BR>

<P>

     The Chrysler Sebring convertible, which utilizes "cab-forward" styling

in a convertible model, was added to Chrysler's product lineup in the 1996 model

year.

<BR>

<P>

     In January 1996, Chrysler announced its intent to produce the Plymouth

Prowler convertible as a 1997 1/2 model unique to the Plymouth brand. The

Prowler draws on the heritage of "street rods" for its retro styling cues, but

offers all the technology and customer convenience of a '90s production car. As

a small volume niche vehicle, the Prowler will serve as a technology testbed for

aluminum body and chassis applications.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler will begin production of a substantially redesigned Jeep

Wrangler in early 1996. It includes an all-new suspension, front and rear, an

all-new interior with an integrated instrument panel, and improved front and

rear passenger accommodations, while maintaining Wrangler's traditional exterior

styling and rugged appearance. Also included are driver and passenger

airbags.

<BR>

<P>

     In March 1996, Chrysler will launch the new Viper GTS, a coupe version

of the original Viper roadster which was the first vehicle developed under

Chrysler's platform team system. In addition, the Dodge Dakota pickup truck will

undergo a major renewal for the 1997 model year.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="015">Automotive Marketing</A></strong>

<P>

     New passenger cars and trucks are sold at retail by dealers who have

sales and service agreements with Chrysler. The dealers purchase cars, trucks,

parts and accessories from Chrysler for sale to retail customers. In the United

States, Chrysler had 4,652 dealers at December 31, 1995 compared with 4,687 at

December 31,

1994. Chrysler Canada had 609 dealers at December 31, 1995 compared with 607

dealers at December 31, 1994.

<BR>

<P>

     The quality and strength of Chrysler's dealer organization will have an

important impact on future sales. Chrysler maintains programs to provide

dealership operating capital through equity investments where sufficient private

capital is not available. The programs anticipate that the dealer receiving such

assistance will eventually use its share of the dealership profits to purchase

Chrysler's equity investment. Chrysler's equity interest in U.S. and Canadian

dealerships totaled $22 million in 51 dealerships as of December 31, 1995,

compared with $28 million in 64 dealerships as of December 31, 1994.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler continues to focus on quality customer service. A redesigned

customer satisfaction survey process provides Chrysler and its franchised

dealers continuous customer feedback regarding dealer sales, service and parts

operations. In addition, the Chrysler Customer Center is designed to promote

customer satisfaction and communicate customer concerns to dealers and

internally to vehicle platform teams.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="016">Manufactured and Purchased Components and Materials</A></strong>

<P>

     Chrysler continues to focus on its core automotive business. Chrysler

manufactures most of its requirements for engines, transmissions and transaxles,

certain body stampings, electronic components, and fabricated glass parts.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler purchases materials, parts and other components from numerous

unaffiliated suppliers. Chrysler used approximately 1,150 suppliers of

productive materials in 1995, compared to approximately 1,250 used in 1994.

Interruptions in production or delivery of these productive materials could

adversely affect Chrysler. Chrysler purchases a larger portion of its productive

materials from unaffiliated suppliers than do its principal competitors and

expects to continue purchasing its requirements for these items rather than

manufacturing them.

<strong><A NAME="017">Government Regulation</A></strong>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="018">Vehicle Regulation</A></strong>

<P>

     Fuel economy, safety and emissions regulations and standards applicable

to motor vehicles have been issued from time to time under a number of federal

statutes, including the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966

(the "Safety Act"), the Clean Air Act, Titles I and V of the Motor Vehicle

Information and Cost Savings Act and the Noise Control Act of 1972. In addition,

the State of California has promulgated exhaust emission standards, some of

which are more stringent than the federal standards. Other states may, under the

Clean Air Act, adopt vehicle emission standards identical to those adopted by

the State of California. The States of New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut,

Maine, and New Jersey have also adopted California standards and several other

states are considering similar action. Federal courts have generally upheld New

York and Massachusetts' adoption of the California standards.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Vehicle Emissions Standards</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Under the Clean Air Act, auto manufacturers are required, among other

things, to significantly reduce tailpipe emissions of polluting gases from

automobiles and light trucks and are obligated to recall vehicles for failure to

meet emission standards for a period of ten years or 100,000 miles, whichever

occurs first. This Act imposes standards for model years through 2003 that

require further significant reductions in motor vehicle emissions and directs

the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") to study the need for much more

stringent emissions standards beginning as early as the 2004 model year. This

Act also directs the EPA to

review the Federal Test Procedure used to measure vehicle tailpipe emissions.

The EPA has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to impose additional test

requirements, potentially increasing the stringency of the test. This Act also

may require production of certain vehicles capable of operating on fuels other

than gasoline or diesel fuel (alternative fuels) under the Clean Fuel Vehicle

Program beginning in the 1998 model year. Chrysler is actively pursuing the

development of flexible fuel vehicles capable of operating on both gasoline and

either methanol or ethanol blend fuels, as well as the development of vehicles

capable of operating on compressed natural gas and liquid petroleum gas.

<BR>

<P>

     The California Air Resources Board ("CARB") has received federal

approval, pursuant to the Clean Air Act, for its Low Emission Vehicle Program

for a series of passenger car and light truck emission standards that are more

stringent than those prescribed by the Clean Air Act for the corresponding

periods of time. These California standards are intended to promote the

development of various classes of low-emission vehicles. Included in this

program is a requirement that a specified percentage of each manufacturer's

California light-duty production volume, beginning at two percent in 1998 and

increasing to ten percent in 2003, be zero-emission vehicles ("ZEVs") that

produce no emissions of regulated pollutants. Chrysler has entered into a

consortium of vehicle manufacturers, electric utilities and the U.S. Department

of Energy to develop new battery technology for use in electric vehicles which

would qualify as ZEVs and has built a limited number of experimental prototype

electric vehicles using existing advanced battery technology. On December 21,

1995, the CARB directed its staff to finalize a plan to modify the ZEV mandate

for model years 1998 - 2002. If adopted, the plan would suspend the ZEV mandate

until model year 2003, and the program will be replaced by market-based action

along with continued research and development on ZEVs as well as a ZEV

demonstration program in California.

<BR>

<P>

     On December 19, 1994, the Administrator of the EPA responded to a

petition filed by the Ozone Transport Commission ("OTC"), a group of 12

Northeast states and the District of Columbia. The response held that the states

comprising the OTC must either adopt the California vehicle emissions standards

or a 49 state program advocated by the American Automobile Manufacturers

Association ("AAMA") (of which Chrysler is a member) and the Association of

International Automobile Manufacturers ("AIAM"). The Administrator's decision

does not require the states that adopt California's general vehicle emission

standards to adopt California's ZEV requirement, but permits the states to adopt

the ZEV requirement if they elect to do so. New York, Massachusetts and Maine

have adopted the California general standards as well as the California ZEV

requirement. Connecticut and New Jersey have adopted the general standards but

not the ZEV requirement. The EPA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on

October 10, 1995, detailing a voluntary 49 state National Low Emission Vehicle

Program which might form the basis of a 49 state program of the type advocated

by AAMA and AIAM.

<BR>

<P>

     The Clean Air Act also requires full implementation of on-board

diagnostic systems ("OBD") on 1996 model year light-duty vehicles. California

has its own OBD requirements which are more stringent than the federal

requirements. These OBD requirements are of concern because they may cause

increased warranty costs and additional recalls.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>CAFE

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, as amended by the

Energy Policy and Conservation Act, requires vehicle manufacturers to provide

vehicles that comply with federally mandated Corporate Average Fuel Economy

("CAFE") standards. Under this Act, a manufacturer earns credits for

exceeding the applicable fuel economy standards; however, fuel economy credits

earned on cars may not be used for trucks. Failure to meet the average fleet

fuel economy standards can result in the imposition of penalties unless a

manufacturer has sufficient fuel economy credits from the preceding three years

or projects that it will generate sufficient credits over the succeeding three

years. Chrysler is in substantial compliance with passenger car CAFE

requirements and anticipates continued compliance with such requirements.

Chrysler anticipates compliance with light-duty truck CAFE through the use of

carryback and carryforward credits. In addition, the Energy Tax Act of 1978

imposes a graduated "Gas Guzzler" tax on automobiles with a fuel economy rating

below specified levels.

<BR>

<P>

     From time to time there have been federal legislative and

administrative initiatives that would increase CAFE standards from their current

levels. In addition, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

("NHTSA") has initiated rulemaking to set more stringent light truck CAFE

standards for the 1998-2006 model years. A significant increase in those

requirements could be costly to Chrysler and could result in significant

restrictions on the products Chrysler offers.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Vehicle Safety

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Under the Safety Act, NHTSA is required to establish federal motor

vehicle safety standards that are practicable, meet the need for motor vehicle

safety and are stated in objective terms. NHTSA has announced its intention to

upgrade certain existing standards and to establish additional standards in the

future. Chrysler expects to be able to comply with those standards.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Vehicle Recalls

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA may require manufacturers to recall

and repair vehicles that fail to meet emission standards established under that

Act. Similarly, the Act authorizes the State of California to require recalls

for vehicles that fail to meet its emissions standards.

<BR>

<P>

     The Safety Act authorizes NHTSA to investigate reported vehicle

problems and to order a recall if it determines that a safety-related defect

exists. NHTSA conducted an engineering analysis of the rear liftgate latches in

Chrysler's 1984-1995 model year minivans (approximately 4 million vehicles) as a

result of allegations that some latches open during collisions. On October 25,

1995, NHTSA closed this investigation and announced that it was satisfied with

Chrysler's voluntary service action to replace the latches in these minivans.

Chrysler began its latch replacement service action in September 1995 and

expects to complete it by the end of 1996.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's emissions and safety-related recall costs vary widely from

year to year, and could be significant in future periods, depending on the

corrective action required to remedy a particular condition and the number of

vehicles involved.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="019">Stationary Source Regulation</A></strong>

<P>

     Chrysler's assembly, manufacturing and other operations are subject to

substantial environmental regulation under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water

Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Pollution Prevention Act of

1990 and the Toxic Substances Control Act, as well as a substantial volume of

state legislation paralleling and, in some cases, imposing more stringent

obligations than the federal requirements. These regulations impose severe

restrictions on air and water-born discharges of pollution from

Chrysler facilities, the handling of hazardous materials at Chrysler facilities

and the disposal of wastes from Chrysler operations. Chrysler is faced with many

similar requirements in its operations in Canada and is facing increased

governmental regulation and environmental enforcement in Mexico.

<BR>

<P>

     While Chrysler is unable to predict the exact level of expenditures

that will be required to develop and implement new technology in its North

American facilities, since federal and state requirements are not fully defined,

Chrysler expects its capital requirements for the period 1996 through 2000 will

be approximately $500 million. Of this total, Chrysler estimates that $130

million will be spent in 1996 and $60 million will be spent in 1997.

Substantially all of these expenditures are included in Chrysler's planned

disbursements for new product development and the acquisition of productive

assets over the 1996 to 2000 period. In addition, the extensive federal-state

permit program established by the Clean Air Act may reduce operational

flexibility and cause delays in upgrading Chrysler's production facilities in

the United States.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Clean Air Act

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Pursuant to the Clean Air Act, states are required to amend their

implementation plans to require more stringent limitations and other controls on

the quantity of pollutants which may be emitted into the atmosphere to achieve

national ambient air quality standards established by the EPA. In addition, the

Clean Air Act requires reduced emissions of substances that are classified as

hazardous, toxic or that contribute to acid deposition, imposes comprehensive

permit requirements for manufacturing facilities in addition to those required

by various states, and expands federal authority to impose severe penalties and

criminal sanctions. The Clean Air Act also allows states to adopt standards more

stringent than those required by the Clean Air Act. Most recent reports filed

with the EPA pursuant to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of

1986 indicate that, for calendar year 1994, releases and emissions of chemicals

and toxins by Chrysler were reduced by more than 70 percent from comparable 1987

levels, even though vehicle production increased more than 10% during this

period.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Environmental Liabilities

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The EPA and various state agencies have notified Chrysler that it may

be a potentially responsible party ("PRP") for the cost of cleaning up hazardous

waste storage or disposal facilities pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental

Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and other federal and state

environmental laws. A number of lawsuits allege that Chrysler violated CERCLA or

other environmental laws and seek to recover costs associated with remedial

action. In most instances, Chrysler is only one of a number of PRPs who may be

found to be jointly and severally liable for remediation costs at the 101 sites

involved in the foregoing matters at December 31, 1995. Chrysler may also incur

remediation costs at an additional 45 of its active or deactivated facilities.

Chrysler's reserves for these environmental matters totalled $271 million as of

December 31, 1995. Chrysler periodically evaluates and revises estimates for

environmental liabilities based on expenditures against established reserves and

the availability of additional information.

<BR>

<P>

     Estimates of future costs of such environmental matters are necessarily

imprecise due to numerous uncertainties, including the enactment of new laws and

regulations, the development and application of new technologies, the

identification of new sites for which Chrysler may have remediation

responsibility and the apportionment and collectibility of remediation costs

among responsible parties. Chrysler establishes reserves for these environmental

matters when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably

possible that final resolution of some of these matters may require Chrysler to

make significant expenditures, in excess of established reserves, over an

extended period of time and in a range of amounts that cannot be reasonably

estimated. Although the final resolution of any such matters could have a

material effect on Chrysler's consolidated operating results for the particular

reporting period in which an adjustment of the estimated liability is recorded,

Chrysler believes that any resulting liability should not materially affect its

consolidated financial position.

     CFC, Chrysler's wholly owned subsidiary, is a financial services

organization that provides retail and lease financing for vehicles, dealer

inventory and other financing needs, dealer property and casualty insurance and

dealership facility development and management primarily for Chrysler dealers

and their customers. CFC, a Michigan corporation, is the continuing corporation

resulting from a merger on June 1, 1967 of a financial services subsidiary of

Chrysler into a newly acquired, previously unaffiliated finance company

incorporated in 1926.

     Receivable sales are a significant source of funding. Net proceeds from

the sale of automotive retail receivables were $6.5 billion during 1995 compared

to $6.4 billion in 1994. Securitization of revolving wholesale account balances

provided funding which aggregated $6.7 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31,

1995 and 1994, respectively. During 1995, CFC issued $4.3 billion of term debt

     For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, Chrysler spent

$1.4 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.2 billion, respectively, for

company-sponsored research and development activities. These activities relate

to the development of new products and services and the improvement of existing

<h3><CENTER><A NAME="023">EMPLOYEES</A></CENTER></h3>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995, Chrysler had a total of approximately 126,000

employees worldwide. Of this total, approximately 85,000 hourly workers and

29,000 salaried workers were employed in the United States and Canada. In the

United States and Canada, approximately 95 percent of Chrysler's hourly

employees and 22 percent of its salaried employees are represented by unions. Of

these represented employees, 97 percent of hourly and 90 percent of salaried

employees are represented by the United Automotive, Aerospace, and Agricultural

Implement Workers of America ("UAW") or the National Automobile, Aerospace and

Agricultural Implement Workers of Canada ("CAW"). The existing national

agreements with the UAW and CAW will expire in September of 1996. Chrysler

cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with the UAW and CAW as to the

renewal of these agreements.

<BR>

<P>

     In 1993, Chrysler negotiated three-year national agreements with the

UAW and CAW in the United States and Canada, respectively, without an

interruption of production. The UAW contract provides for essentially the same

levels of wages and benefits as negotiated by Chrysler's major domestic

competitors. The UAW contract retains the job and income security protection

program and health care coverage. The job and income security benefit caps were

negotiated at the previous contract amount of $612 million with new Supplemental

Unemployment Benefits Contingency Accounts of $106 million. The contract also

adopted

provisions expected to abate future increases in labor costs including Cost of

Living Allowance diversions, lower new hire rates, and a broadened approach to

managed health care.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's pension plans, group life, and health care benefits for

active, inactive, and retired employees generally follow the structure of

benefits common to the automotive industry. See Part II, Item 8, Notes to

Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes 1, 11 and 12 for further information on

postemployment benefits, pension plans, and nonpension postretirement

benefits.

<P>

<h3><CENTER><A NAME="026">AUTOMOTIVE OPERATIONS</A></CENTER></h3>

<P>

     The statements concerning ownership of Chrysler's properties are made

without regard to taxes or assessment liens, rights of way, contracts, easements

or like encumbrances or questions of survey and are based on the records of

Chrysler. Chrysler knows of no material defects in title to, or adverse claims

against, any of such properties, nor any existing material liens or encumbrances

against Chrysler or its properties.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's manufacturing plants include a foundry, machining plants,

metal stamping plants, engine plants, transmission plants, electronic parts

plants, an air conditioning equipment plant, glass fabricating plants and other

component parts plants. In addition to Michigan, manufacturing plants in the

United States are located in Alabama, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Texas and

Wisconsin.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's U.S. passenger car assembly plants are located in Sterling

Heights and Detroit, Michigan; Belvidere, Illinois and Newark, Delaware. The

U.S. truck assembly plants are located in Warren and Detroit, Michigan; Fenton,

Missouri; and Toledo, Ohio. Parts depots, warehouses and sales offices are

situated in various sections of the United States, while Chrysler's principal

engineering and research facilities and its general offices are located in

Auburn Hills, Michigan.

<BR>

<P>

     Automotive properties outside the U.S. are owned or leased principally

by Chrysler Canada and Chrysler Mexico. Other manufacturing and assembly plants

of subsidiaries outside the U.S. are located in Venezuela and Austria.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's technology center in Auburn Hills, Michigan consists of 3.4

million square feet of floor space and includes design, vehicle engineering,

manufacturing engineering and pilot build facilities associated with the

development of new Chrysler cars and trucks. The technology center was completed

and fully occupied in the first half of 1994. The facility was subsequently

expanded by approximately 1.0 million square feet of floor space and includes an

administrative building, which serves as Chrysler's World Headquarters and

principal place of business. The expansion is scheduled for completion in the

first half of 1996. In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Board of Directors

approved a project to build a new Powertrain Test Center. The Powertrain Test

Center will include powertrain test cells, its related support laboratories,

emissions development and road test simulators. The building will add

approximately 430,000 square feet of floor space to the facility and is

scheduled for completion in the year 2000.

<BR>

<P>

     In the opinion of management, Chrysler's properties include facilities

which are suitable and adequate for the conduct of its present assembly and

component plant requirements. The annual productive capacity of Chrysler's

worldwide automotive operations was approximately 2.6 million units in 1995,

compared to 2.4 million units in 1994. Chrysler's worldwide assembly plants

operated at 95 percent of capacity in 1995, compared to 110 percent of capacity

in 1994 (with capacity determined based on two eight-hour shifts). Capacity

utilization in 1995 was lower than 1994 primarily as a result of the changeover

and launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans during 1995. The launch of Chrysler's

all-new minivans was substantially complete by the end of 1995.

<BR>

<P>

<h3><A NAME="028">Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</A></h3>

<P>

     Chrysler and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings,

including some purporting to be class actions, and some which demand large

monetary damages or other relief which, if granted, would require significant

expenditures. Chrysler believes that each of the product and environmental

proceedings described below constitutes ordinary routine litigation incidental

to the business conducted by Chrysler. See also Note 8 of Notes To Consolidated

Financial Statements.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="029">Product Matters</A></strong>

<P>

     Many of the legal proceedings seek damages for personal injuries

claimed to have resulted from alleged defects in the design or manufacture of

products distributed by Chrysler. The complaints filed in those matters

specify approximately $1.2 billion in compensatory and $932 million in punitive

damages in the aggregate as of December 31, 1995. These amounts represent

damages sought by plaintiffs and, therefore, do not necessarily constitute an

accurate measure of Chrysler's ultimate cost to resolve those matters. Further,

many complaints do not specify a dollar amount of damages or specify only the

jurisdictional minimum. These amounts may vary significantly from one period to

the next depending on the number of new complaints filed or pending cases

resolved in a given period.

<BR>

<P>

     Numerous complaints seek damages for personal injuries sustained in

accidents involving alleged rollovers of Jeep CJ vehicles. These complaints

represent approximately $302 million of the compensatory and $755 million of the

punitive damages specified above. Pursuant to an indemnification agreement with

Chrysler, Renault has agreed to indemnify Chrysler against a portion of certain

costs arising from accidents involving alleged Jeep CJ vehicle rollovers that

occurred between April 1, 1985 and March 31, 1994.

<BR>

<P>

     Many of the remaining complaints seek compensatory and punitive damages

for personal injuries sustained in accidents involving alleged defects in

occupant restraint systems, seats, heater cores, liftgate latches, or various

other components in several different vehicle models. Some complaints seek

repair of the vehicles or compensation for the alleged reduction in vehicle

value.

<BR>

<P>

     Five purported class action lawsuits seeking unspecified economic

damages in connection with rear liftgate latches on Chrysler's 1984-1994 model

year minivans have been consolidated in Federal District Court in San Francisco.

Chrysler previously announced a voluntary owner service action to replace those

latches. The parties agreed to a proposed settlement that requires Chrysler to

achieve a 60% response rate to its service action by December 31, 1996, or spend

$14 million on consumer notices and incentives aimed at increasing the response

rate. Chrysler will also be required to pay $5.2 million in attorneys fees and

costs. Notices were sent to class members in September 1995 following the

Court's preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 30, 1995, the Court

approved the consolidated settlement as fair, reasonable and adequate to protect

the interests of the class members. Certain parties have objected to the

settlement ruling, but no date has been set for a hearing on those

objections.

<BR>

<P>

     Four purported class action lawsuits were filed against Chrysler in the

second half of 1995 alleging defects in the antilock braking system (ABS) found

in some of its 1991-1995 model year vehicles. The lawsuits seek compensatory and

punitive damages, restitution, repair, and/or profits from vehicle sales.

<BR>

<P>

     Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of

individual matters is not predictable with assurance. It is reasonably possible

that the final resolution of some of these matters may require Chrysler to make

expenditures, in excess of established reserves, over an extended period of time

and in a range of amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated. Although the

final resolution of any such matters could have a material effect on Chrysler's

consolidated operating results for the particular reporting period in which an

adjustment of the estimated liability is recorded, Chrysler believes that any

resulting liability should not materially affect its consolidated financial

position.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="030">Environmental Matters</A></strong>

<P>

     The EPA and various state agencies have notified Chrysler that it may

be a PRP for the cost of cleaning up hazardous waste storage or disposal

facilities pursuant to the CERCLA and other federal and state environmental

laws. A number of lawsuits allege that Chrysler violated CERCLA or other

environmental laws and seek to recover costs associated with remedial action. In

most instances, Chrysler is only one of a number of PRPs who may be found to be

jointly and severally liable for remediation costs at the 101 sites involved in

the foregoing matters at December 31, 1995. Chrysler may also incur remediation

costs at an additional 45 of its active or deactivated facilities. Chrysler's

reserves for these environmental matters totalled $271 million as of December

31, 1995. Chrysler periodically evaluates and revises estimates for

environmental liabilities based on expenditures against established reserves and

the availability of additional information.

<BR>

<P>

     The Indiana Department of Environmental Management initiated an

administrative proceeding in August 1985 alleging improper disposal of waste at

a Chrysler facility in Indianapolis. This proceeding, which seeks to require

Chrysler to conduct a site assessment and undertake remedial action, may result

in the imposition of civil penalties in excess of $100,000.

<BR>

<P>

     The State of Wisconsin filed a lawsuit in February 1995 against

Chrysler Outboard Corporation, a Chrysler subsidiary subsequently merged into

Chrysler, alleging improper disposal of hazardous waste in 1969. This lawsuit,

which seeks unspecified damages, may result in the imposition of civil penalties

in excess of $100,000.

<BR>

<P>

     Estimates of future expenditures in connection with these environmental

matters are necessarily imprecise due to numerous uncertainties, including the

enactment of new laws and regulations, the development and application of new

technologies and the apportionment and collectibility of remediation costs among

responsible parties. Chrysler establishes reserves for these environmental

matters when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably

possible that final resolution of some of these matters could require Chrysler

to make significant expenditures, in excess of established reserves, over an

extended period of time and in a range of amounts that cannot be reasonably

estimated. Although the final resolution of any such matters could have a

material effect on Chrysler's consolidated operating results for the particular

reporting period in which an adjustment of the estimated liability is recorded,

Chrysler believes that any resulting liability should not materially affect its

consolidated financial position.

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="031">Other Matters</A></strong>

<P>

     In December 1990 and January 1991, eight class action lawsuits were

commenced by separate plaintiffs against Chrysler and certain of its directors

in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for New Castle County,

Delaware. The Complaints in these suits are very similar and allege that the

directors breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders by amending Chrysler's

Share Purchase Rights Plan in a manner designed to entrench themselves in office

and to impair the right of stockholders to avail themselves of offers to

purchase their shares by an acquiror not favored by management. The Complaints

ask for (a) certification of the class, (b) rescission of and an injunction

against implementation of the Rights Plan amendments, (c) an order that Chrysler

cooperate with Kirk Kerkorian, the holder of 9.8% of Chrysler's common stock at

the time the complaints were filed, and take steps to enhance its attractiveness

as a merger/acquisition candidate, and (d) damages and costs. On January 9,

1991, the eight suits were consolidated into one. On January 28, 1991, Chrysler

filed an Answer and Affirmative Defenses in the consolidated case. On March 7,

1991, the parties agreed to allow an Amended Complaint to be filed which

purports to assert a derivative claim brought on behalf of Chrysler, in addition

to class action claims as originally filed. In this regard, the Amended

Complaint alleges injury to Chrysler as a direct result of violations of

fiduciary duties by the individual defendants. On July 25, 1991, Chrysler filed

a motion to dismiss the consolidated lawsuit. On July 27, 1992, the Court

entered a memorandum opinion dismissing the complaint as to all claims for

relief other than rescission. Chrysler later filed a Motion for Reargument which

was denied on August 11, 1992. On June 6, 1995, Chrysler entered into a

Memorandum of Understanding which contemplates settlement of the litigation. The

Memorandum is subject to several conditions, including satisfactory completion

of discovery as to the fairness of the proposed settlement, and the settlement

itself is subject to Court approval. The Memorandum also contemplates that the

settlement, if approved, will consist of Chrysler's action in December 1994

further amending its Rights Plan. A hearing on the settlement has been scheduled

by the Court for February 26, 1996.

<BR>

<P>

     In April 1995, thirty four class action lawsuits were commenced by

separate plaintiffs against Chrysler, certain of its current and former

directors and, in some cases, Tracinda Corporation, a holding company wholly

owned by Kirk Kerkorian and the beneficial owner of more than 13% of the

outstanding common stock of Chrysler as of December 31, 1995, and its

affiliates, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for New Castle

County, Delaware. The Complaints in these suits fall into two general

categories: (a) those which allege that the directors breached their fiduciary

duties to stockholders by failing to negotiate with Tracinda regarding its

proposal to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Chrysler not then owned by

it; and (b) those which allege that the directors breached their fiduciary

duties to stockholders by contemplating, planning and/or effecting Tracinda's

proposal at a time when the market price of Chrysler's stock was depressed and

did not reflect its true value. The Complaints in the former category ask for,

among other things, (a) an injunction or an order obligating the Board of

Directors to undertake an evaluation of alternatives, including measures with

respect to Chrysler's Rights Plan, designed to maximize shareholder value, (b) a

declaration that the defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to the

plaintiffs, (c) compensatory damages and interest, and (d) costs and fees. The

Complaints in the latter category ask for, among other things, (a) a declaration

that the transaction proposed by Tracinda is unfair, unjust and inequitable, (b)

an injunction against implementation of the transaction proposed by Tracinda and

any improper

device which impedes maximization of shareholder value, (c) damages and

interest, (d) costs and fees, and (e) such other relief as may be just and

proper. Four of these actions have subsequently been dismissed without prejudice

by the plaintiffs.

results, liquidity and financial condition and its ability to continue its

capital expenditure and vehicle development programs and market its vehicles

successfully. Chrysler's ability to pay dividends is also affected by the

provision in its credit agreement that it must maintain a ratio of indebtedness

<EM>1995 Compared With 1994

<P>

     Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes and the cumulative

effect of a change in accounting principle of $3.4 billion in 1995, compared

with $5.8 billion in 1994. Net earnings for 1995 were $2.0 billion, or $5.11 per

fully diluted common share, compared with $3.7 billion, or $9.10 per fully

diluted common share in 1994. Earnings in 1994 represented an all-time record

for Chrysler. Earnings in 1995 were the third best in Chrysler's history.

Earnings in 1995 were reduced by a $263 million charge ($162 million after

income taxes) for costs associated with production changes at Chrysler's Newark

assembly plant and a $115 million charge ($71 million after income taxes) for a

voluntary minivan owner service action. Net earnings in 1995 also include a

charge of $96 million, or $0.24 per fully diluted common share, for the

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the consensus

reached on Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales

with a Guaranteed Minimum Resale Value." Net earnings for 1994 included

favorable tax adjustments aggregating $132 million.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler also reported earnings before income taxes of $1,659 million

in the fourth quarter of 1995, compared with $1,631 million in the fourth

quarter of 1994. Earnings before income taxes for the fourth quarter of 1995

represented an all-time record for Chrysler and earnings before income taxes for

the fourth quarter of 1994 were the second best in Chrysler's history. Net

earnings for the fourth quarter of 1995 were $1,040 million, or $2.67 per fully

diluted common share, compared with $1,168 million, or $2.86 per fully diluted

common share in the fourth quarter of 1994. Net earnings for the fourth quarter

of 1994 included favorable tax adjustments aggregating $132 million. Net

earnings for the fourth quarter of 1994 represented an all-time record for

Chrysler and net earnings for the fourth quarter of 1995 were the second best

quarter in Chrysler's history. Chrysler's worldwide factory car and truck

shipments in the fourth quarter of 1995 were 741,770 units, an increase of

16,824 units or 2 percent from fourth quarter 1994 levels.

<BR>

<P>

     The lower operating results for full year 1995 compared with 1994

resulted primarily from lower minivan shipments and costs associated with the

launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans, higher sales incentives and material

costs, a lower mix of higher-margin vehicles, lower factory shipments in Mexico

and the costs associated with production changes at the Newark assembly

plant.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's worldwide factory car and truck shipments in 1995 were

2,673,539 units, a decrease of 88,564 units or 3 percent from 1994 levels.

Minivan factory shipments in 1995 were 555,824 units, a decrease of 121,652

units from 1994 levels. The decline in minivan factory shipments was primarily

attributable to the launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans at its assembly plants

in Fenton, Missouri; Windsor, Ontario; and Graz, Austria. By the end of 1995,

the launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans was substantially complete. Minivan

factory shipments in the fourth quarter of 1995 were 167,615 units as compared

with 167,839 units in the fourth quarter of 1994.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's revenues and results of operations are derived principally

from the U.S. and Canada automotive marketplaces. Retail sales of new cars and

trucks in the U.S. and Canada were 16.3 million units in 1995, compared with

16.7 million units in 1994, a decrease of 2 percent. This decrease was primarily

due to a slowdown in economic growth caused primarily by increases in interest

rates. As a result, Chrysler increased retail sales incentives and lowered

production during 1995.

<P>

     The decline in Chrysler's U.S. truck market share during 1995 was

primarily due to a decrease in retail sales of Chrysler's minivans largely

offset by a net increase in retail sales of Chrysler's other truck models. The

decrease in minivan retail sales was primarily due to the launch of Chrysler's

all-new minivans. With the completion of the minivan launch and the launch of

Chrysler's full-size Dodge Ram pickup truck at two additional facilities,

Chrysler believes it is well positioned to meet the growing demand for

trucks.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler manufactured 207,004 vehicles and 238,888 vehicles in Mexico

in 1995 and 1994, respectively. Of these totals, 26,503 vehicles and 77,832

vehicles were sold in Mexico in 1995 and 1994, respectively. Sales of vehicles

exported to Mexico were not significant in 1995 or 1994. The decrease in

vehicles manufactured and sold in Mexico was primarily attributable to

unfavorable economic conditions in Mexico, commencing with the devaluation of

the Mexican peso in December 1994. Chrysler's operating results will continue to

be adversely affected to the extent that the unfavorable economic conditions in

Mexico continue. Although Chrysler expects economic conditions in Mexico to

improve slightly in 1996, Chrysler cannot predict when Mexican automotive

industry sales will return to predevaluation levels.

<BR>

<P>

     In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF")

of the Financial Accounting Standards Board reached a consensus on EITF Issue

95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed Minimum Resale Value." The

consensus on EITF Issue 95-1 (the "consensus") affects Chrysler's accounting

treatment for vehicle sales (principally to non-affiliated rental car companies)

for which Chrysler conditionally guarantees the minimum resale value of the

vehicles. In accordance with the consensus, these vehicle sales are accounted

for as operating leases with the related revenues and costs deferred at the time

of shipment. A portion of the deferred revenues and costs is recognized over the

corresponding guarantee period, with the remainder recognized at the end of the

guarantee period. The average guarantee period for these vehicles is

approximately nine months. Chrysler changed its accounting treatment in

accordance with the consensus effective January 1, 1995 which resulted in the

recognition of an after-tax charge of $96 million for the cumulative effect of

this change in accounting principle. The ongoing effect of this accounting

change was not material to 1995 earnings.

<BR>

<P>

     CFC's earnings before income taxes were $522 million in 1995, compared

with $315 million in 1994. CFC's net earnings were $339 million in 1995,

compared with $195 million in 1994. The increase in earnings

in 1995 was primarily attributable to higher levels of automotive financing,

lower operating expenses and lower costs of bank facilities.

<BR>

<P>

     For the past three years, Chrysler has benefitted from several factors,

including: (1) favorable economic conditions in the U.S. and Canada, where

Chrysler's sales are concentrated, (2) a cost advantage in comparison to

vehicles manufactured in Japan (or vehicles containing significant material

components manufactured in Japan) as a result of favorable exchange rates

between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar, and (3) a continuing shift in U.S.

and Canada consumer preferences toward trucks, as Chrysler manufactures a higher

proportion of trucks to total vehicles than its principal competitors in the

U.S. and Canada. A significant deterioration of any of these factors could

adversely affect Chrysler's operating results. In addition, Chrysler has

benefitted from a strategy of focusing resources on its core automotive business

and an aggressive capital expenditure and vehicle development program that has

resulted in the replacement of substantially all of its car and truck offerings

over the last four years. Chrysler's long-term profitability will depend

significantly on its ability to continue its capital expenditure and vehicle

development programs and market its vehicles successfully.

     Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes and the cumulative

effect of changes in accounting principles of $5.8 billion in 1994, compared

with $3.8 billion in 1993. The earnings in 1993 included gains on sales of

automotive assets and investments totaling $265 million.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler reported net earnings for 1994 of $3.7 billion, compared to a

net loss for 1993 of $2.6 billion. Net earnings for 1994 included favorable tax

adjustments aggregating $132 million. The net loss for 1993 resulted from a

charge of $4.7 billion for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting

principle related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

("SFAS") No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than

Pensions." Also included in the 1993 results was a charge of $283 million for

the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relating to the

adoption of SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits"

and a $72 million favorable adjustment of Chrysler's deferred tax assets and

liabilities as a result of the increased U.S. federal income tax rate.

<BR>

<P>

     The improvement in earnings in 1994 over 1993 was primarily the result

of an increase in shipments, a reduction in lower-margin fleet shipments in

proportion to total retail sales and reduced sales incentives, partially offset

by increased profit-based employee compensation costs. Chrysler's worldwide

factory car and truck shipments in 1994 were 2,762,103 units, an increase of

286,365 units or 12 percent from 1993 levels.

     The increase in sales of manufactured products in 1995 as compared with

1994 primarily reflects an increase in average revenue per unit, net of sales

incentives, from $17,663 to $18,305, largely offset by a 3 percent decrease in

factory shipments. The increase in average revenue per unit in 1995 as compared

with 1994 was primarily due to pricing actions, partially offset by higher sales

incentives. The increase in sales of manufactured products in 1994 as compared

with 1993 was primarily due to a 12 percent increase in factory shipments and an

increase in average revenue per unit, net of sales incentives, from $16,461 to

$17,663. The increase in average revenue per unit in 1994 as compared with 1993

was principally due to reduced sales incentives and sales of an increased

proportion of trucks to total vehicles.

<BR>

<P>

     The increase in finance and insurance revenues in 1995 as compared with

1994 was primarily attributable to higher levels of automotive financing volume.

The decrease in finance and insurance revenues in 1994 as compared with 1993 was

primarily attributable to reduced nonautomotive financing revenue, resulting

from sales and liquidations of CFC's nonautomotive receivables, partially offset

by increased levels of automotive financing volume. Total automotive financing

volume in 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $81.9 billion, $70.4 billion and $59.8

billion, respectively. The increases in automotive financing volume over the

last two years reflects higher retail lease penetration and higher levels of

dealer financing.

     Costs, other than items below increased in 1995 as compared with 1994

primarily as a result of increased product costs, costs associated with the

changeover and launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans and costs associated with

production changes at the Newark assembly plant, partially offset by the effect

of a decrease in factory shipments of 3 percent. The increase in product costs

in 1995 resulted primarily from higher material costs (including increased

product content) and higher warranty costs. Warranty costs in 1995 included a

charge of $115 million related to a voluntary minivan owner service action and

the effect of enhanced warranty programs. Costs, other than items below

increased in 1994 as compared with 1993 primarily due to a 12 percent increase

in factory shipments. Costs, other than items below as a percent of sales of

manufactured products were 83 percent, 77 percent and 79 percent in 1995, 1994

and 1993, respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     Depreciation of property and equipment in 1995 increased as compared

with 1994 primarily as a result of higher levels of property and equipment in

use. Depreciation of property and equipment in 1994 was comparable to 1993 as

increases resulting from higher levels of property and equipment in use were

largely offset by reductions at CFC resulting from the sales and downsizing of

its nonautomotive financing operations. Special tooling amortization increased

in 1995 as compared with 1994 primarily as a result of increased tooling costs

for Chrysler's new products. Special tooling amortization increased in 1994 as

compared with 1993 primarily as a result of the shortening of the remaining

service lives of certain special tools in 1994.

<BR>

<P>

     Selling and administrative expenses increased in 1995 as compared with

1994 primarily as a result of advertising costs related to Chrysler's all-new

minivans, sedans and coupes. Selling and administrative expenses increased in

1994 as compared with 1993 primarily as a result of increased advertising and

profit-based employee compensation costs.

<BR>

<P>

     Pension expense decreased in 1995 as compared with 1994 due to improved

funding of the pension plans and an increase in the discount rate used to

determine 1995 pension expense. Pension expense decreased in 1994 as compared

with 1993 due to improved funding of the pension plans, partially offset by

increases resulting from a reduction in the discount rate used to determine 1994

pension expense and benefit increases from Chrysler's 1993 national contracts

with its principal bargaining units. Chrysler's contributions to the pension

fund during 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $838 million, $2.6 billion and $3.5

billion, respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     Nonpension postretirement benefit expense decreased in 1995 as compared

with 1994 primarily as a result of an increase in the discount rate used to

determine 1995 nonpension postretirement benefit expense and favorable health

care inflation experience. Nonpension postretirement benefit expense increased

slightly in

1994 as compared with 1993, as increases resulting from a reduction in the

discount rate used to determine nonpension postretirement benefit expense in

1994 were partially offset by cost savings associated with the implementation of

new managed care initiatives. Nonpension postretirement benefit expense is

expected to increase in 1996 primarily as a result of a reduction in the

discount rate used to determine this expense.

<BR>

<P>

     Interest expense increased slightly in 1995 as compared with 1994

primarily as a result of higher levels of term debt at CFC largely offset by a

decrease in average non-CFC debt levels. The decline in interest expense in 1994

as compared with 1993 was primarily due to reductions in CFC's effective cost of

borrowings, resulting from higher levels of commercial paper, which have lower

costs than borrowings under CFC's bank facilities. CFC's average effective cost

of borrowings was 7.9 percent, 8.0 percent and 8.6 percent in 1995, 1994 and

1993, respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     In 1995, Chrysler recorded a $263 million provision for costs

associated with production changes at its Newark assembly plant. The plant ended

production of Chrysler's LeBaron convertibles in July 1995. In addition, Newark

production of the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid was reduced to one shift

in August 1995 and will end prior to the production of a new vehicle in the fall

of 1997. The provision includes the recognition of supplemental unemployment

benefits, job security benefits and other related employee costs, and the

write-down of certain equipment and tooling. The provision is included in Costs,

other than items below in the consolidated statement of earnings.

<BR>

<P>

     Operating results for 1993 included gains on sales of automotive assets

and investments of $265 million. The 1993 pretax gain was comprised of a $205

million gain on the sales of an aggregate of 50.3 million shares of MMC stock

and a $60 million gain on the sale of Chrysler's plastics operations.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's effective tax rates in 1995, 1994 and 1993 were 38.5

percent, 36.3 percent and 37.1 percent, respectively. The provision for income

taxes in 1994 included favorable adjustments aggregating $132 million, including

$100 million for the recognition of tax credits related to expenditures in prior

years for qualifying research and development activities. The 1993 provision for

income taxes included a favorable adjustment of Chrysler's deferred tax assets

and liabilities resulting from an increased U.S. federal tax rate.

<h3><CENTER><A NAME="040">LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</A></CENTER></h3>

<P>

     Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

totaled $8.1 billion at December 31, 1995 (including $1.2 billion held by CFC

and Car Rental Operations), compared with $8.4 billion at December 31, 1994

(including $756 million held by CFC and Car Rental Operations). At December 31,

1995, $394 million of CFC's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable

securities were limited for use in its insurance operations in accordance with

various statutory requirements. The decrease in Chrysler's consolidated combined

cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in 1995 was the result of

capital expenditures, net finance receivables acquired and common stock

repurchases, largely offset by cash generated by operating activities and cash

provided by an increase in long-term debt. The increase in Chrysler's

consolidated combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $3.3

billion in 1994 was the result of cash generated by operating activities,

partially offset by capital expenditures and pension contributions.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's long-term profitability will depend significantly on its

ability to continue its capital expenditure and vehicle development programs and

market its vehicles successfully. Chrysler's expenditures for new product

development and the acquisition of productive assets were $14.9 billion for the

three-year period ended December 31, 1995. Expenditures for these items during

the succeeding three-year period are expected to be at similar or higher levels.

At December 31, 1995, Chrysler had commitments for capital expenditures,

including commitments for assets currently under construction, totaling

approximately $1.2 billion.
<BR>

<P>

     In December 1994, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion

common stock repurchase program commencing in the first quarter of 1995. In

September 1995, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved an increase in the

program to $2 billion to be completed by the end of 1996, depending on market

conditions. During 1995, Chrysler repurchased 23 million shares of its common

stock under this program at a cost of $1.1 billion (including $23 million in

unsettled repurchases). In addition, holders of the Series A Convertible

Preferred Stock converted 1.6 million shares of preferred stock into 44.1

million shares of common stock during 1995.

<BR>

<P>

     In the second quarter of 1995, Chrysler increased its quarterly

dividend from $0.40 to $0.50 per common share. In the fourth quarter of 1995,

Chrysler increased its quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.60 per common share,

the highest dividend rate in Chrysler's history.

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995, Chrysler (excluding CFC) had aggregate debt

maturities of $469 million through 1998. During 1995, Chrysler redeemed its $300

million 13% Debentures Due 1997 and repaid $185 million of other debt. In

December 1995, Thrifty issued $450 million of long-term debt ($190 million of

6.6% notes and $260 million of floating rate notes which at December 31, 1995

had a weighted average interest rate of 6.7%). At December 31, 1995, Chrysler

had a $1.7 billion revolving credit agreement which expires in July 1999. None

of the commitment was drawn upon at December 31, 1995. Chrysler believes that

cash from operations and its cash position will be sufficient to enable it to

meet its capital expenditure, debt maturity, common stock repurchase, dividend

payment and other funding requirements.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's ability to market its products successfully depends

significantly on the availability of vehicle financing for its dealers and, to a

lesser extent, the availability of financing for retail and fleet customers,

both of which are provided by CFC.

<BR>

<P>

     Term debt, commercial paper and receivable sales are CFC's primary

funding sources. CFC increased its term debt outstanding by $3.1 billion and

$880 million during 1995 and 1994, respectively. CFC's commercial paper

outstanding decreased by $1.9 billion during 1995 and increased by $1.5 billion

in 1994. CFC realized $6.5 billion and $6.4 billion of net proceeds from the

sales of automotive retail receivables during 1995 and 1994, respectively. In

addition, securitization of revolving wholesale account balances provided

funding for CFC which aggregated $6.7 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31,

1995 and 1994, respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995, CFC had debt maturities of $4.1 billion in 1996

(including $2.4 billion of short-term notes), $3.0 billion in 1997, and $2.1

billion in 1998. During the second quarter of 1995, CFC entered into new

revolving credit facilities which replaced its existing U.S. and Canadian

revolving credit and receivable sale facilities. The new facilities, which total

$8.0 billion, consist of a $2.4 billion facility expiring in May 1996 and a $5.6

billion facility expiring in May 2000. As of December 31, 1995, no amounts were

outstanding under these facilities. CFC believes that cash provided by

operations, receivable sales, access to term debt markets and the issuance of

commercial paper will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its debt maturity and

other funding requirements.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's strategy is to focus on its core automotive business. As

part of this strategy, Chrysler has sold certain assets and businesses in past

years which are not related to its core automotive business, and is exploring

the sale of other such assets and businesses in the near term.

<BR>

<P>

<h3><CENTER><A NAME="041">NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS</A></CENTER></h3>

<P>

     In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for

the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed

Of," effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. This

Statement establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived

assets, certain identifiable

intangibles, and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and

long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of. The

Statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles

to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or

changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not

be recoverable. In addition, the Statement requires that certain long-lived

assets and identifiable intangibles to be disposed of be reported at the lower

of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Chrysler believes that the

implementation of this new accounting standard will not have a material impact

on its consolidated operating results or financial position. Chrysler will adopt

this accounting standard on January 1, 1996, as required.

<BR>

<P>

     In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for

Stock-Based Compensation," effective for fiscal years beginning after December

15, 1995. This Statement encourages entities to use a fair value based method of

accounting for stock-based compensation plans. This Statement also requires

certain disclosures about stock-based employee compensation arrangements

regardless of the method used to account for them. Pro forma disclosures are

required for entities that continue to apply the provisions of Accounting

Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." The

pro forma amounts will reflect the difference between compensation cost, if any,

included in net income and the related cost measured by the fair value based

method as defined in this Statement, including tax effects, if any, that would

have been recognized in the income statement if the fair value method had been

used. Chrysler intends to adopt this Statement on a disclosure only basis.

Chrysler will adopt this accounting standard on January 1, 1996, as

required.

<P>

<STRONG><EM>Consolidation and Financial Statement Presentation

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The consolidated financial statements of Chrysler Corporation and its

consolidated subsidiaries ("Chrysler") include the accounts of all significant

majority-owned subsidiaries and entities. Intercompany accounts and transactions

have been eliminated in consolidation. Amounts for 1994 and 1993 have been

reclassified to conform with current period classifications.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Estimates

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The preparation of Chrysler's financial statements in conformity with

generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates

and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and

disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial

statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the

reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Revenue Recognition

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF")

of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") reached a consensus on EITF

Issue 95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed Minimum Resale

Value." The consensus on EITF Issue 95-1 (the "consensus") affects Chrysler's

accounting treatment for vehicle sales (principally to non-affiliated rental car

companies) for which Chrysler conditionally guarantees the minimum resale value

of the vehicles. In accordance with the consensus, these vehicle sales are

accounted for as operating leases with the related revenues and costs deferred

at the time of shipment. A portion of the deferred revenues and costs is

recognized over the corresponding guarantee period, with the remainder

recognized at the end of the guarantee period. The average guarantee period for

these vehicles is approximately nine months. Chrysler changed its accounting

treatment in accordance with the consensus effective January 1, 1995 which

resulted in the recognition of an after-tax charge of $96 million, or $0.25 per

common share, for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle.

The ongoing effect of this accounting change was not material to 1995

earnings.

<BR>

<P>

     Vehicle and parts sales are generally recognized when such products are

shipped to dealers, except for sales under which Chrysler conditionally

guarantees the minimum resale value of the vehicles. Provisions for sales

allowances and incentives are recognized at the time the related sale is

recognized and are treated as revenue reductions.

<BR>

<P>

     Finance revenue from finance receivables of Chrysler Financial

Corporation ("CFC"), a wholly owned subsidiary, is recognized using the interest

method. Certain loan and lease origination costs are deferred and amortized to

finance revenue over the contractual terms. Recognition of finance revenue is

generally suspended when a loan or lease becomes contractually delinquent for

periods ranging from 60 to 90 days. Finance revenue recognition is resumed when

the loan or lease becomes contractually current, at which time all past due

finance revenue is recognized.

<BR>

<P>

     CFC sells significant amounts of automotive retail and wholesale

receivables in transactions subject to limited recourse provisions. CFC

generally sells its receivables to a trust and remains as servicer, for which it

is paid a servicing fee. Normal servicing fees are earned on a level yield basis

over the remaining terms of the related sold receivables. In a subordinated

capacity, CFC retains excess servicing cash flows, a limited interest in the

principal balances of the sold receivables and certain cash deposits provided as

credit enhancements for investors. Gains or losses from the sales of retail

receivables are recognized in the period in which such sales

occur. In determining the gain or loss for each qualifying sale of retail

receivables, the investment in the sold receivable pool is allocated between the

portion sold and the portion retained, based on their relative fair values on

the date of sale.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Depreciation and Tool Amortization

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated

depreciation. Depreciation is generally provided on a straight-line basis. At

December 31, 1995, the weighted average service lives of assets were 34 years

for buildings (including improvements and building equipment), 14 years for

machinery and equipment and 10 years for furniture and fixtures. Special tooling

costs are amortized over the years that a model using that tooling is expected

to be produced, and within each year based on the units produced. Amortization

is deducted directly from the asset account. During any given model year,

special tools will contain tooling with varying useful lives.

<BR>

<P>

     Effective April 1, 1994, Chrysler revised the estimated service lives

of certain special tools and property and equipment. These revisions were based

on updated assessments of the service lives of the related assets and resulted

in the recognition of additional amortization of special tools of $246 million

in 1994 and lower depreciation of property and equipment of $45 million in

1994.

<BR>

<P>

     Expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and other product-related

costs are expensed as incurred. Provisions for product warranty costs are

recognized at the time the related sale is recognized. Advertising expense was

$1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $858 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,

respectively. Research and development costs were $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and

$1.2 billion in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     Highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at

the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Marketable Securities

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Effective January 1, 1994, Chrysler adopted Statement of Financial

Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in

Debt and Equity Securities." Adoption of this accounting standard did not have a

material effect on Chrysler's financial statements.

<BR>

<P>

     Under SFAS No. 115, debt and equity securities with readily

determinable fair values are segregated into one of the following categories --

trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Trading securities and

available-for-sale securities are carried at their fair values. Changes in the

fair values of trading securities are recorded in the statement of earnings.

Changes in the fair values of available-for-sale securities are recognized as a

component of shareholders' equity until such securities are sold.

Held-to-maturity securities are carried at cost adjusted for amortized premium

or discount.

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995 and 1994, Chrysler had investments in securities

(including cash equivalents) with an aggregate carrying value of $7.3 billion

and $7.9 billion, respectively, accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 115.

These securities consisted primarily of commercial paper, federal government

agency

securities and corporate debt. At December 31, 1995, securities categorized as

available-for-sale and held-to-maturity totaled $6.6 billion and $677 million,

respectively. At December 31, 1994, securities categorized as available-for-sale

and held-to-maturity totaled $5.5 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.

Substantially all such securities have maturities within one year.

<BR>

<P>

     On December 29, 1995, CFC transferred all of its securities classified

as held-to-maturity to available-for-sale. At the date of transfer, the

amortized cost and unrealized gain of the securities transferred totaled $283

million and $9 million, respectively. This transfer resulted from CFC conducting

a one-time reassessment of the classification of securities held in accordance

with FASB Special Report, "A Guide to Implementation of Statement 115 on

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Allowance for Credit Losses

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     An allowance for credit losses is generally established during the

period in which receivables or vehicle leases are acquired. The allowance for

credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate, based primarily on

loss experience. Other factors affecting collectibility are also evaluated and

appropriate adjustments are recorded. Retail automotive receivables and vehicle

leases not supported by a dealer guaranty are charged to the allowance for

credit losses net of the estimated value of repossessed collateral at the time

of repossession. Nonautomotive finance receivables are reduced to the estimated

fair value of the collateral when such loans are deemed to be impaired.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Inventories

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost of

approximately 42 percent and 51 percent of inventories at December 31, 1995 and

1994, respectively, was determined on a Last-In, First-Out ("LIFO") basis. The

balance of inventory cost was determined on a First-In, First-Out ("FIFO")

basis.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Intangible Assets

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The purchase price of companies in excess of the value of net

identifiable assets acquired ("goodwill") is amortized on a straight-line basis

over periods of up to 40 years. The amount is reported net of accumulated

amortization of $767 million and $723 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994,

respectively. Chrysler periodically evaluates the carrying value of goodwill for

impairment. Such evaluations are based principally on the projected,

undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the goodwill relates.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Postemployment Benefits

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Effective January 1, 1993, Chrysler adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers'

Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which required the accrual of benefits

provided to former or inactive employees after employment but prior to

retirement. Prior to 1993, Chrysler accrued for certain of these benefits at the

time an employee's active service ended and expensed certain other benefits on

the basis of cash expenditures. Adoption of this accounting standard resulted in

the recognition of an after-tax charge of $283 million, or $0.82 per common

share, for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Derivative Financial Instruments

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler manages risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates and

currency exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments. Chrysler does

not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

<BR>

<P>

     When Chrysler sells vehicles outside the United States or purchases

components from suppliers outside the United States, transactions are frequently

denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Periodically, Chrysler

initiates hedging activities by entering into currency exchange agreements,

consisting principally of currency forward contracts and purchased options, to

minimize revenue and cost variations which could result from fluctuations in

currency exchange rates. These instruments, consistent with the underlying

purchase or sale commitments, typically mature within two years of origination.

The currency exchange agreements are treated as off-balance sheet financial

instruments, with related gains and losses recorded in the settlement of the

underlying transactions. In the event of an early termination of a currency

exchange agreement designated as a hedge, the gain or loss continues to be

deferred and is included in the settlement of the underlying transaction.

Chrysler also uses written currency options to effectively close out existing

purchased options, both of which are then carried at fair value. Previously

unrecognized gains and losses on the purchased options continue to be deferred

and are included in the settlement of the underlying transaction.

<BR>

<P>

     CFC utilizes interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, forward interest

rate contracts and currency exchange agreements to manage funding costs and

exposure arising from changes in interest and currency exchange rates. Interest

differentials resulting from interest rate swap agreements used to change the

interest rate characteristics of CFC's debt are recorded on an accrual basis as

an adjustment to interest expense. Interest rate swaps are either matched with

specific term debt obligations or with groups of commercial paper on a layered

basis. Forward interest rate contracts are used to manage exposure to

fluctuations in funding costs for anticipated securitizations of retail

receivables. Unrealized gains or losses on forward interest rate contracts that

qualify for hedge accounting treatment are deferred. Unrealized gains or losses

on forward interest rate contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting

treatment are included in other revenues. Realized gains or losses for hedge

instruments are included in the determination of the gain or loss from the

related sales of retail receivables. In the event of an early termination of an

interest rate exchange agreement designated as a hedge, the gain or loss is

deferred and recorded as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining

term of the underlying debt. In addition, CFC enters into currency exchange

agreements to manage its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates

related to specific borrowings denominated in currencies other than the local

currency of the borrowing entity. As a result, such borrowings are translated in

the consolidated balance sheet at the rates of exchange established under the

related currency exchange agreement.

     Retained interests in sold receivables are generally restricted and

subject to limited recourse provisions. At December 31, 1994, CFC was a party to

an interest rate cap agreement related to $134 million of its retained

     At December 31, 1995, aggregate annual maturities of consolidated debt,

including principal payments on capital leases, were as follows (in millions of

dollars): 1996-$4,335; 1997-$2,973; 1998-$2,354; 1999-$1,804; and 2000-$925.

<BR>

<P>

     CFC enters into currency exchange agreements to manage its exposure to

fluctuations in currency exchange rates related to specific borrowings

denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the borrowing entity.

As a result, such borrowings are translated in the consolidated balance sheet at

the rates of exchange established under the related currency exchange agreement.

The reported amount of such borrowings was $330 million. If CFC had not entered

into currency exchange agreements, the amount would have been $175 million

higher at December 31, 1995.

<BR>

<P>

     To mitigate risks associated with changing interest rates on certain of

its debt, CFC has entered into interest rate exchange agreements. CFC manages

exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into such agreements only with

major financial institutions that are expected to fully perform under the terms

of such

agreements. The notional amounts are used to measure the volume of these

agreements and do not represent exposure to credit loss. The impact of interest

rate exchange agreements on interest expense was immaterial in 1995, 1994 and

1993.

     During the second quarter of 1995, CFC entered into new revolving

credit facilities which replaced its existing U.S. and Canadian revolving credit

and receivable sale facilities. The new facilities, which total $8.0 billion,

consist of a $2.4 billion facility expiring in May 1996 and a $5.6 billion

facility expiring in May 2000. As of December 31, 1995, no amounts were

outstanding under these facilities.

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995, Chrysler had a $1.7 billion revolving credit

agreement which expires in July 1999. None of the commitment was drawn upon at

December 31, 1995.

     Chrysler does not provide for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding

taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as such cumulative

earnings of $2.1 billion are intended to be permanently reinvested in those

operations. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized

deferred tax liability for these undistributed foreign earnings.

year 2009; alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration

dates. NOL carryforwards totaled $218 million at December 31,

1995, and may be used through the year 2008. The valuation allowance was

principally related to a subsidiary's NOL carryforwards. Changes in the

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Litigation

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Various claims and legal proceedings have been asserted or instituted

against Chrysler, including some purporting to be class actions, and some which

demand large monetary damages or other relief which could result in significant

expenditures. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of

individual matters is not predictable with assurance. It is reasonably possible

that the final resolution of some of these matters may require Chrysler to make

expenditures, in excess of established reserves, over an extended period of time

and in a range of amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated. The term

"reasonably possible" is used herein to mean that the chance of a future

transaction or event occurring is more than remote but less than likely.

Although the final resolution of any such matters could have a material effect

on Chrysler's consolidated operating results for the particular reporting period

in which an adjustment of the estimated liability is recorded, Chrysler believes

that any resulting liability should not materially affect its consolidated

financial position.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Environmental Matters

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler is subject to potential liability under government regulations

and various claims and legal actions which are pending or may be asserted

against Chrysler concerning environmental matters. Estimates of future costs of

such environmental matters are necessarily imprecise due to numerous

uncertainties, including the enactment of new laws and regulations, the

development and application of new technologies, the identification of new sites

for which Chrysler may have remediation responsibility and the apportionment and

collectibility of remediation costs among responsible parties. Chrysler

establishes reserves for these environmental matters when the loss is probable

and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that final resolution of

some of these matters may require Chrysler to make significant expenditures, in

excess of established reserves, over an extended period of time and in a range

of amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated. Although the final resolution of

any such matters could have a material effect on Chrysler's consolidated

operating results for the particular reporting period in which an adjustment of

the estimated liability is recorded, Chrysler believes that any resulting

liability should not materially affect its consolidated financial position.

<EM>Possible Disposition of Assets and Businesses

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's strategy is to focus on its core automotive business. As

part of this strategy, Chrysler has sold certain assets and businesses in past

years which are not related to its core automotive business, and is exploring

the sale of other such assets and businesses in the near term. Although Chrysler

cannot reasonably estimate the gains or losses that may result from the sales of

such assets and businesses, if any, such gains or losses could have a material

effect on Chrysler's consolidated operating results. However, Chrysler believes

that such gains or losses should not materially affect its consolidated

financial position.

     At December 31, 1995, Chrysler had a total of approximately 126,000

employees worldwide. Of this total, approximately 85,000 hourly workers and

29,000 salaried workers were employed in the U.S. and Canada. In the U.S. and

Canada, approximately 95 percent of Chrysler's hourly employees and 22 percent

of its salaried employees are represented by unions. Of these represented

employees, 97 percent of hourly and 90 percent of salaried employees are

represented by the United Automotive, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement

Workers of America ("UAW") or the National Automobile, Aerospace, and

Agricultural Implement Workers of Canada ("CAW"). The existing national

agreements with the UAW and CAW will expire in September of 1996.

     The majority of Chrysler's lease payments are for operating leases. At

December 31, 1995, Chrysler had the following minimum rental commitments under

noncancelable operating leases: 1996-$341 million; 1997-$182 million; 1998-$99

million; 1999-$77 million; 2000-$61 million; and 2001 and thereafter-$201

million. Future minimum lease commitments have not been reduced by minimum

sublease rentals of $218 million due in the future under noncancelable

subleases.

<BR>

<P>

     Rental expense for operating leases with original expiration dates

beyond one year was $436 million, $407 million and $410 million in 1995, 1994

and 1993, respectively. Sublease rentals of $58 million, $60 million, and $61

million were received in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     Chrysler had commitments for capital expenditures, including

commitments for assets currently under construction, approximating $1.2 billion

at December 31, 1995.

     At December 31, 1995, Chrysler had guaranteed obligations of others in

the amount of $301 million, none of which were secured by collateral.

<strong><A NAME="056">Note 9. Stock Options and Performance-Based Compensation</A></strong>

<P>

     The Chrysler Corporation 1991 Stock Compensation Plan (the "1991 Plan")

provides that Chrysler may grant stock options to officers, key employees and

nonemployee directors and also may grant reload stock options (which are options

granted when outstanding options are exercised by payment in stock), stock

appreciation rights (payable in cash or stock, at the sole discretion of the

Stock Option Committee) and limited stock appreciation rights (payable in cash

in the event of a change in control). The 1991 Plan also provides for awarding

restricted stock units and performance stock units, which reward service for

specified periods or attainment of performance objectives. The Chrysler

Corporation Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), initially adopted in 1972 and

readopted in 1982, was amended to incorporate certain features of the 1991

Plan.

<BR>

<P>

     Under the Plan and the 1991 Plan, outstanding options, consisting of

ten-year nonqualified stock options, have exercise prices of not less than the

market value of Chrysler common stock at the date of grant. Options generally

become exercisable on up to 40 percent of the shares after one year from the

date of grant, 70 percent after two years and 100 percent after three years.

Information with respect to options granted under the Plan and the 1991 Plan,

including the conversion of American Motors Corporation ("AMC") options

outstanding at the date of the AMC acquisition, was as follows:

<P>

     Shares available for granting options at the end of 1995, 1994 and 1993

were 11.2 million, 15.1 million, and 1.5 million, respectively. At December 31,

1995, 6.2 million options with prices ranging from $43.19 to $57.00 were not yet

exercisable under the terms of the Plan and the 1991 Plan.

<BR>

<P>

     In addition to the Plan and the 1991 Plan, Chrysler has programs under

which additional compensation is paid to hourly and salaried employees based

upon various measures of Chrysler's performance. Such performance-based

compensation programs include incentive compensation and profit sharing paid to

certain hourly and salaried employees.

* Less than $1 million

<BR>

<P>

     During December 1994, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved a $1

billion common stock repurchase program commencing in the first quarter of 1995.

In 1995, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved an increase in the program to $2

billion to be completed by the end of 1996, depending on market conditions. In

1995, Chrysler repurchased 23 million shares of its common stock under this

program at a cost of $1,070 million (including $23 million in unsettled

repurchases).

<BR>

<P>

     The annual dividend on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the

"Preferred Stock") is $46.25 per share. The Preferred Stock is convertible,

unless previously redeemed, at a rate (subject to adjustment in

certain events) of 27.78 shares of common stock for each share of Preferred

Stock. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to January 22, 1997.

Thereafter, Chrysler may redeem the Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at

$523.13 per share of Preferred Stock for the period ending December 31, 1997 and

thereafter declining ratably annually to $500.00 per share after December 31,

2001, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. During 1995, holders of substantially

all of the Preferred Stock converted their shares into shares of common

stock.

<BR>

<P>

     In February 1988, the Board of Directors declared and distributed a

dividend of one Preferred Share Purchase Right (a "Right") for each then

outstanding share of Chrysler's common stock and authorized the distribution of

one Right with respect to each subsequently issued share of common stock. Each

Right, as most recently amended, entitles a shareholder to purchase one

one-hundredth of a share of Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock of

Chrysler at a price of $120. The Rights are attached to the common stock and are

not represented by separate certificates or exercisable until the earliest to

occur of (i) 10 days following the time (the "Stock Acquisition Time") of a

public announcement or communication to Chrysler that a person or group of

persons has acquired or obtained the right to acquire 15 percent or more of

Chrysler's outstanding common stock, and (ii) 10 business days after a person or

group of persons announces or commences a tender offer that would result, if

successful, in the bidder owning 15 percent or more of Chrysler's outstanding

common stock. If the acquiring person or group acquires 15 percent or more of

the common stock (except pursuant to a tender offer made for all of Chrysler's

common stock, and determined by Chrysler's independent directors to be fair and

in the best interests of Chrysler and its shareholders) each Right (other than

those held by the acquiror) will entitle its holder to buy, for $120, a number

of shares of Chrysler's common stock having a market value of $240. Similarly,

if after the Stock Acquisition Time, Chrysler is acquired in a merger or other

business combination and is not the surviving corporation, or 50 percent or more

of its assets, cash flow or earning power is sold, each Right (other than those

held by the surviving or acquiring company) will entitle its holder to purchase,

for $120, shares of the surviving or acquiring company having a market value of

$240. Chrysler's directors may redeem the Rights at $0.05 per Right, and may

amend the Rights or extend the time during which the Rights may be redeemed,

only prior to the Stock Acquisition Time. Additionally, at any time after a

person or group acquires 15 percent or more, but less than 50 percent, of

Chrysler's common stock, Chrysler's directors may exchange the Rights (other

than those held by the acquiror), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of

one share of common stock (or a fractional share of preferred stock with

equivalent voting rights) per Right. The Rights will expire on February 22,

1998.

<BR>

<P>

     Of the 1.0 billion shares of authorized common stock at December 31,

1995, 53 million shares were reserved for issuance under Chrysler's various

employee benefit plans and the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

<BR>

<P>

     Primary earnings (loss) per common share amounts were computed by

dividing earnings (loss) after deduction of preferred stock dividends by the

average number of common and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding. Fully

diluted per-common-share amounts assume conversion of the Preferred Stock, the

elimination of the related preferred stock dividend requirement, and the

issuance of common stock for all other potentially dilutive equivalents

outstanding. Fully diluted per-common-share amounts are not applicable for loss

periods.

<A NAME="058"><strong>Note 11. Pension Plans</strong></A>

<P>

     Chrysler's pension plans provide noncontributory and contributory

benefits. The noncontributory pension plans cover substantially all of the

hourly and salaried employees of Chrysler and certain of its consolidated

subsidiaries. Benefits are based on a fixed rate for each year of service.

Additionally, contributory benefits are provided to substantially all salaried

employees of Chrysler and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries under the

Salaried Employees' Retirement Plan. This plan provides benefits based on the

employee's cumulative contributions, years of service during which employee

contributions were made, and the employee's average salary during the

consecutive five years in which salary was highest in the 15 years preceding

retirement.

<BR>

<P>

     Contributions to the pension trust fund for U.S. plans are in

compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

All pension trust fund assets and income accruing thereon are used solely to pay

pension benefits and administer the plans. Chrysler made pension fund

contributions totaling $838 million in 1995, $2.6 billion in 1994 and $3.5

billion in 1993.

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995, plan assets were invested in a diversified

portfolio that consisted primarily of debt and equity securities, including 11.9

million shares of Chrysler common stock with a market value of $658 million.

During 1995, $29 million of dividends were received on Chrysler common

stock.

     During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the cost of voluntary early retirement

programs, which are periodically offered to certain salaried and hourly

employees, was $21 million, $68 million and $40 million, respectively, and is

included in pension expense.

<BR>

<P>

     Pension expense is determined using assumptions at the beginning of the

year. The projected benefit obligation ("PBO") is determined using the

assumptions at the end of the year. Assumptions used to determine pension

expense and the PBO were:

     The decrease in the discount rate for U.S. Plans from 8.63 percent as

of December 31, 1994 to 7.00 percent as of December 31, 1995 resulted in a $1.7

billion increase in the PBO at December 31, 1995 and is expected to result in an

$89 million increase in 1996 pension expense.

<strong><A NAME="059">Note 12. Nonpension Postretirement Benefits</A></strong>

<P>

     Chrysler provides health and life insurance benefits to substantially

all of its hourly and salaried employees and those of certain of its

consolidated subsidiaries. Upon retirement from Chrysler, employees may become

eligible for continuation of these benefits. However, benefits and eligibility

rules may be modified periodically. Prior to 1993, the expense recognized for

these benefits was based primarily on cash expenditures for the period.

Effective January 1, 1993, Chrysler adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting

for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which requires the accrual of

such benefits during the years employees provide services. The adoption of this

accounting standard resulted in an after-tax charge of $4.7 billion, or $13.57

per common share, in 1993. Implementation of SFAS No. 106 did not increase

Chrysler's cash expenditures for postretirement benefits.

<BR>

<P>

     The decrease in the discount rate from 8.6 percent to 7.0 percent as of

December 31, 1995 resulted in a $1.6 billion increase in the ANPBO in 1995, and

benefit expense in 1996.

<BR>

<P>

     A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care inflation

rate in each year would have increased the ANPBO at December 31, 1995 by $1.2

billion and would have increased the aggregate of the service and interest cost

components of nonpension postretirement benefit expense in 1995 by $105

million.

<strong><A NAME="060">Note 13. Sales of Automotive Assets and Investments</A></strong>

<P>

     During 1994, Chrysler sold its wire harness operations and certain of

its soft trim operations, and entered into five-year supply agreements with each

of the purchasers. Aggregate net proceeds from the sales and the supply

agreements were $315 million. The related pretax gains of $254 million were

deferred and are being recognized over the periods of the respective supply

agreements.

<BR>

<P>

     In 1993, Chrysler sold its plastics operations for net proceeds of $132

million. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $60 million ($39 million after

income taxes). Also during 1993, Chrysler sold its remaining 50.3 million shares

of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation stock for net proceeds of $329 million,

resulting in a pretax gain of $205 million ($128 million after income

taxes).

<BR>

<P>

<strong><A NAME="061">Note 14. Special Plant Provision</A></strong>

<P>

     During 1995, Chrysler recorded a $263 million provision ($162 million

after income taxes) for costs associated with production changes at its Newark

assembly plant. The plant ended production of Chrysler's LeBaron convertibles in

July 1995. In addition, Newark production of the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge

Intrepid was reduced to one shift in August 1995 and will end prior to

production of a new vehicle in the fall of 1997. The provision includes the

recognition of supplemental unemployment benefits, job security benefits and

other related employee costs, and the write-down of certain equipment and

tooling. The provision is included in Costs, other than items below in the

consolidated statement of earnings.

     The carrying value of variable-rate finance receivables was assumed to

approximate fair value since they are priced at current market rates. The fair

value of fixed-rate finance receivables was estimated by discounting expected

cash flows using rates at which loans of similar maturities would be made as of

the date of the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of excess servicing

cash flows and other subordinated amounts due CFC arising from receivable sale

transactions were estimated by discounting expected cash flows.

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Debt

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The fair value of public debt was estimated using quoted market prices.

The fair value of other long-term debt was estimated by discounting future cash

flows using rates currently available for debt with similar terms and remaining

maturities.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Currency exchange agreements

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The fair values of currency exchange agreements were estimated by

discounting the expected cash flows using market exchange rates and relative

market interest rates over the remaining terms of the agreements. Currency

exchange agreements are more fully described in Notes 1 and 6.

</STRONG><EM>Interest rate exchange agreements

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward

interest rate contracts were estimated by discounting expected cash flows using

quoted market interest rates. Interest rate exchange agreements are more fully

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Currency forward and option contracts

     The fair values of currency forward and option contracts were estimated

based on quoted market prices for contracts of similar terms. Currency forward

and option contracts are more fully described in Note 1.

<BR>

<P>

     Although not a counterparty to certain derivative financial instruments

entered into between securitization trusts and third parties, CFC receives an

indirect beneficial interest from such instruments.

     The fair value estimates presented herein were based on information

available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. Although management

is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair

value amounts, such amounts have not been revalued since the date of the

consolidated balance sheet and, therefore, current estimates of fair value may

differ from the amounts presented herein.

Industry Segment Data

</STRONG>

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler operates in two principal industry segments: Car and Truck and

Financial Services. The Car and Truck segment is comprised of the automotive

operations of Chrysler, which includes the research, design, manufacture,

assembly and sale of cars, trucks and related parts and accessories. Based on

assets, revenues and earnings, automotive operations represent the majority of

Chrysler's business activities. The Financial Services segment is comprised of

CFC, which is engaged principally in retail and lease financing for vehicles,

dealer inventory and other financing needs, dealer property and casualty

insurance, and dealership facility development and management. Chrysler also

participates in short-term vehicle rental activities through its Car Rental

Operations and engages in aircraft modification and the manufacture of

electronics products and systems through its Chrysler Technologies Corporation

subsidiary ("CTC"). The Car Rental Operations and CTC, each represent less than

10 percent of revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets, and have been

included in the Car and Truck segment. Chrysler's operations are conducted

primarily in North America including the United States, Canada and Mexico.

<P>

Shareholders and Board of Directors

<BR>

Chrysler Corporation

<BR>

Auburn Hills, Michigan

<BR>

<P>

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler

Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and

the related consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for each of the

three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial statements

are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to

express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

<BR>

<P>

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing

standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain

reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material

misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting

the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes

assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by

management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<BR>

<P>

     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,

in all material respects, the financial position of Chrysler Corporation and

consolidated subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of

their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period

ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting

principles.

<BR>

<P>

     As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, in 1995 the

Company changed its method of accounting for sales of vehicles for which it has

guaranteed a minimum resale value.

<h3><CENTER><A NAME="066">MANAGEMENT REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY 

FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING</A></CENTER></h3>

     Chrysler's management is responsible for preparing the financial

statements and other financial information in this Annual Report. This

responsibility includes maintaining the integrity and objectivity of financial

data and the presentation of Chrysler's results of operations and financial

position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The

financial statements include amounts that are based on management's best

estimates and judgments.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche

LLP, independent auditors. Their audits were conducted in accordance with

generally accepted auditing standards and included consideration of the internal

control system and tests of transactions as part of planning and performing

their audits.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler maintains a system of internal controls that provides

reasonable assurance that its records reflect its transactions in all material

respects and that significant misuse or loss of assets will be prevented.

Management believes the system of internal controls is adequate to accomplish

these objectives on a continuous basis. Chrysler maintains a strong internal

auditing program that independently assesses the effectiveness of the internal

controls and recommends possible improvements. Management considers the

recommendations of the General Auditor and Deloitte & Touche LLP concerning the

system of internal controls and takes appropriate actions to respond to these

recommendations.

<BR>

<P>

     The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee composed

solely of nonemployee directors, is responsible for determining that management

fulfills its responsibilities in the preparation of financial statements and the

maintenance of internal controls. In fulfilling its responsibility, the Audit

Committee recommends independent auditors to the Board of Directors for

appointment by the shareholders. The Audit Committee also reviews the

consolidated financial statements and adequacy of internal controls. The Audit

Committee meets regularly with management, the General Auditor and the

independent auditors. Both the independent auditors and the General Auditor have

full and free access to the Audit Committee, without management representatives

present, to discuss the scope and results of their audits and their views on the

adequacy of internal controls and the quality of financial reporting.

<BR>

<P>

     It is the business philosophy of Chrysler to obey the law and to

require that its employees conduct their activities according to the highest

standards of business ethics. Management reinforces this philosophy by numerous

actions, including issuing a Code of Ethical Behavior and maintaining a Business

Practices Committee and a Business Practices Office to support compliance with

Chrysler's policies.

<BR>

<P>

<P>

(1) Previously reported results for the first quarter of 1995 have been

            restated to include a $96 million charge for the cumulative effect

            of a change in accounting principle related to the consensus reached

            on Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 95-1, "Revenue

            Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed Minimum Resale Value." The

            ongoing effect of this accounting change was not material to

            Chrysler's 1995 quarterly results. First quarter results also

            included a $115 million pretax charge for a voluntary minivan owner

            service action.

<BR>

<P>

(2) Results for the second quarter of 1995 included a $232 million

            pretax provision for costs associated with production changes at

            Chrysler's Newark assembly plant. The provision includes the

            recognition of supplemental unemployment benefits, job security

            benefits and other related employee costs, and the write-down of

            certain equipment and tooling. During the third quarter of 1995,

            this provision was increased by $31 million to $263 million,

            primarily reflecting changes in the estimate for job security

            benefit costs.

<BR>

<P>

(3) Earnings for the fourth quarter of 1994 included favorable

            adjustments to the provision for income taxes aggregating $132

            million. These adjustments related to: (1) the recognition of tax

            credits related to expenditures in prior years for qualifying

            research and development activities, in accordance with an Internal

            Revenue Service settlement which was based on U.S. Department of

            Treasury income tax regulations issued in 1994, and (2) the reversal

            of valuation allowances related to tax benefits associated with net

            operating loss carryforwards.

This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental Operations

on an Equity Basis)," reflects the results of operations of Chrysler with its

investments in Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") and its investments in

short-term vehicle rental subsidiaries (the "Car Rental Operations") accounted

for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries. This

Supplemental Information does not purport to present results of operations in

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because it does not

comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 94,

"Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." Because the operations of

CFC and the Car Rental Operations are different in nature than Chrysler's

manufacturing operations, management believes that this disaggregated financial

data enhances an understanding of the consolidated financial statements.

<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>Primary earnings (loss) per common share amounts were computed

             by dividing earnings (loss) after deduction of preferred stock

             dividends by the average number of common and dilutive equivalent

             shares outstanding. In 1995 and 1994, fully diluted per common

             share amounts assume conversion of the convertible preferred stock,

             the elimination of the related preferred stock dividend

             requirement, and the issuance of common stock for all other

             potentially dilutive equivalent shares outstanding. Computations of

             primary earnings (loss) per common share exclude the effect of

             common stock equivalents and shares contingently issuable for any

             year in which their inclusion would have the effect of increasing

             the earnings per common share amount or decreasing the loss per

             common share amount otherwise computed. Fully diluted per common

             share amounts are not applicable for loss periods.

(1) In 1991, earnings were not sufficient to cover fixed charges. The

            coverage deficiency was $897 million.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by

                 dividing Earnings available for fixed charges by Total fixed

                 charges. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred

                 stock dividend requirements is computed by dividing Earnings

                 available for fixed charges by the sum of Total fixed charges

                 and Preferred stock dividend requirements.

</CENTER><p>
<strong><A NAME="note1">Note 1. Consolidation and Financial Statement Presentation</A></strong>
<P>
     The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Chrysler Corporation
and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Chrysler") include the accounts of all
significant majority-owned subsidiaries and entities. Intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial
statements of Chrysler for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1996
and 1995 reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring items,
which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement
of the results for the interim periods. The operating results for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 1996 are not necessarily indicative of the
results of operations for the entire year. Reference should be made to the
consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 1995. Certain amounts for 1995 have been
reclassified to conform with current period classifications.

</PRE>
<strong><A NAME="note3">Note 3. Changes in Accounting Principles</A></strong>
<P>
     Effective January 1, 1996, Chrysler adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The adoption of
this new accounting standard did not have a material impact on Chrysler's
consolidated operating results or financial position. Also see <a href="#note8">Note 8.</a>
<BR>
<P>
     Effective January 1, 1995, Chrysler changed its accounting treatment
for vehicle sales for which Chrysler conditionally guarantees the minimum resale
value of the vehicles in accordance with the consensus reached on Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue 95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed
Minimum
Resale Value." In accordance with the consensus, these vehicle sales are
accounted for as operating leases with the related revenues and costs deferred
at the time of shipment. A portion of the deferred revenues and costs is
recognized over the corresponding guarantee period, with the remainder
recognized at the end of the guarantee period. The average guarantee period for
these vehicles is approximately nine months. Implementation of this accounting
change resulted in the recognition of an after-tax charge of $96 million, or
$0.13 per common share, for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle. Previously reported results for the nine months ended September 30,
1995 have been restated to reflect the cumulative effect of this accounting
change.
<BR><p>
<strong><A NAME="note4">Note 4. Two-For-One Stock Split</A></strong>
<P>
     On May 16, 1996, Chrysler's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
stock split to be effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend which was
distributed on July 15, 1996 to shareholders of record on June 15, 1996. All per
share data and the average common and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding
have been adjusted to reflect this stock split for all periods presented. The
number of common shares issued, outstanding and held in treasury as of September
30, 1996 have been adjusted to reflect this stock split. In addition, the par
value of the new shares issued as a result of the two-for-one stock split has
been transferred from additional paid-in capital to common stock. Additional
paid-in capital, common stock balances, common
shares issued, outstanding and held in treasury for prior periods have not been
restated for the two-for-one stock split.
<BR><p>
<strong><A NAME="note5">Note 5. Common Stock Repurchases</A></strong>
<P>
     During the first quarter of 1996, Chrysler's Board of Directors
approved an increase in Chrysler's planned 1996 common stock repurchases from $1
billion to $2 billion and approved an additional $1 billion of common stock
repurchases for 1997. These common stock repurchases are subject to market and
general economic conditions. During the third quarter and first nine months of
1996, Chrysler repurchased 15.8 million and 51.9 million shares, respectively,
of its common stock at a cost of $452 million and $1,570 million, respectively
(including $24 million in unsettled repurchases). Share amounts have been
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.
<BR><p>
<strong><A NAME="note6">Note 6. Sale of Nonautomotive Assets</A></strong>
<P>
     On June 14, 1996, Chrysler completed the sale of Electrospace Systems,
Inc. ("ESI") and Chrysler Technologies Airborne Systems, Inc. ("CTAS"), for net
proceeds of $476 million. ESI and CTAS were engaged principally in the
manufacture of defense electronics and aircraft modification, respectively, and
represented substantially all of the operations of Chrysler Technologies
Corporation. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $101 million ($87 million
after taxes) and is included in Costs, other than items below in the
consolidated statement of earnings for the nine months ended September 30,
1996.
<BR>
<P>
     During the third quarter of 1996, Chrysler Financial Corporation sold
certain nonautomotive assets for net proceeds of $225 million. The sale resulted
in an immaterial loss.
<BR><p>
<strong><A NAME="note7">Note 7. Plant Provision</A></strong>
<P>
     The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 1995
include a $263 million provision ($162 million after taxes) for costs associated
with production changes at the Newark assembly plant. The provision reflects the
recognition of supplemental unemployment benefits, job security benefits and
other related employee costs, and the write-down of certain equipment and
tooling. The provision is included in Costs, other than items below in the
consolidated statement of earnings for the nine months ended September 30,
1995.
<BR><p>
<strong><A NAME="note8">Note 8. Loss on Assets to Be Sold</A></strong>
<P>
     Consistent with its strategy to focus on its core automotive business,
in the second quarter of 1996, Chrysler committed to a plan of disposal for
Thrifty Rent-A-Car System, Inc. ("Thrifty"). In accordance with SFAS No. 121, a
pretax loss of $65 million ($100 million after taxes) was recognized in the
second quarter of 1996 to write down Thrifty's carrying value to estimated fair
value less cost to sell. Chrysler's estimate of the fair value of Thrifty is
based principally on an analysis of non-binding bids. The pretax loss is
included in Costs, other than items below in the consolidated statement of
earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 1996. The after-tax loss
includes the effect of not being able to claim a tax deduction for the capital
loss on Chrysler's investment in Thrifty. Thrifty's assets and liabilities at
September 30, 1996 and its results of operations for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 1996 were immaterial to Chrysler's consolidated assets and
liabilities and results of operations, respectively. Chrysler is continuing to
negotiate for the sale of Thrifty and is uncertain when the sale of Thrifty will
be completed.
<BR><p>
<strong><A NAME="note9">Note 9. Voluntary Early Retirement Program</A></strong>
<P>
     The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 1996 include an $88 million provision ($55 million after taxes) for costs
associated with a voluntary early retirement program for certain salaried
employees. The provision is included in Employee retirement benefits in the
consolidated statement of earnings for the three and nine months ended September
30, 1996.

<P>
     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. All per share data
has been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.
<BR><p>
<CENTER><strong>FINANCIAL REVIEW</strong></CENTER>
<P>
     Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes and the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle of $1,111 million for the third
quarter of 1996, compared with $582 million for the third quarter of 1995. For
the first nine months of 1996, Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes
and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $4,501 million,
compared with $1,790 million for the first nine months of 1995. Net earnings for
the third quarter of 1996 were $680 million, or $0.93 per common share, compared
with $354 million, or $0.45 per common share, for the third quarter of 1995. Net
earnings for the first nine months of 1996 were $2,722 million, or $3.65 per
common share, compared with $985 million, or $1.28 per common share, for the
first nine months of 1995.
<BR>
<P>
     Earnings for the third quarter and first nine months of 1996 include a
charge of $88 million ($55 million after taxes) for costs associated with a
voluntary early retirement program for certain salaried employees. Earnings for
the first nine months of 1996 also include a gain of $101 million ($87 million
after taxes) from the sale of Electrospace Systems, Inc. ("ESI") and Chrysler
Technologies Airborne Systems, Inc. ("CTAS"), and a charge of $65 million ($100
million after taxes) related to a write-down of Thrifty Rent-A-Car System, Inc.
("Thrifty"). Earnings for the first nine months of 1995 include a $263 million
charge ($162 million after taxes) for costs associated with production changes
at Chrysler's Newark assembly plant and a charge of $115 million ($71 million
after taxes) for a voluntary minivan owner service action. Net earnings for the
first nine months of 1995 include a charge of $96 million, or $0.13 per common
share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to
the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") 95-1, "Revenue
Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed Minimum Resale Value."

</PRE>
<P>
     Excluding the items listed above, the improvement in operating results
in the third quarter of 1996 as compared with the third quarter of 1995 resulted
primarily from an increase in vehicle shipments and pricing actions, partially
offset by increased profit-based employee compensation costs. Excluding the
items listed above, the improvement in operating results in the first nine
months of 1996 as compared with the first nine
months of 1995 resulted primarily from an increase in vehicle shipments, pricing
actions, and a reduction in average sales incentives per vehicle, partially
offset by increased profit-based employee compensation costs. The increase in
shipments in the third quarter and first nine months of 1996 was primarily due
to increased shipments of minivans and Dodge Ram pickup trucks. Minivan
shipments in the third quarter and first nine months of 1995 were adversely
affected by the changeover and launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans. The
increase in shipments of Dodge Ram pickup trucks in the third quarter and first
nine months of 1996 primarily reflects production at two additional
facilities.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler's worldwide shipments in the third quarter and first nine
months of 1996 were 650,529 units and 2,205,474 units, respectively, compared
with 581,853 units and 1,931,769 units, respectively, in the third quarter and
first nine months of 1995.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler's revenues and results of operations are principally derived
from the U.S. and Canada automotive marketplaces. In the third quarter of 1996,
retail (including fleet) sales of new cars and trucks in
the U.S. and Canada, on a Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate basis, were 16.5
million units, compared with 16.6 million units for the third quarter of
1995.

<P>
(1) All retail sale and market share data include fleet sales.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler's U.S. car market share increased in the third quarter and
first nine months of 1996 primarily as a result of increased sales of its
midsize sedans and coupes, including the new Plymouth Breeze and Chrysler
Sebring convertible. The increase in Chrysler's U.S. truck market share for the
third quarter and first nine months of 1996 primarily reflects increased sales
of its Dodge Ram pickup trucks, Jeep(R) sport utility vehicles, and
minivans.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") reported pretax earnings of $144
million for the third quarter of 1996 as compared with $138 million for the
third quarter of 1995. For the first nine months of 1996, CFC reported pretax
earnings of $453 million as compared with $374 million for the first nine months
of 1995. CFC's net earnings for the third quarter and first nine months of 1996
were $94 million and $293 million, respectively, as compared with $87 million
and $242 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 1995. The
increase in net earnings in the third quarter of 1996 as compared with the third
quarter of 1995 primarily reflects net margin improvements partially offset by
higher operating expenses and provisions for credit losses. The increase in net
earnings for the first nine months of 1996 as compared with the first nine
months of 1995 primarily reflects net margin improvements and higher gains from
increased receivable sales partially offset by an increase in operating
expenses.

<P>
     The increase in sales of manufactured products in the third quarter of
1996 as compared with the third quarter of 1995 primarily reflects a 12 percent
increase in vehicle shipments and an increase in average revenue per unit, net
of sales incentives, from $19,110 in the third quarter of 1995 to $20,765 in the
third quarter of 1996. The increase in sales of manufactured products in the
first nine months of 1996 as compared with the first nine months of 1995
primarily reflects a 14 percent increase in vehicle shipments and an increase in
average revenue per unit, net of sales incentives, from $18,309 in the first
nine months of 1995 to $19,243 in the first nine months of 1996. The increase in
average revenue per unit in the third quarter and first nine months of 1996 was
principally due to pricing actions and an increased proportion of truck
shipments to total vehicle shipments.
<BR>
<P>
     The increase in finance and insurance revenues for the third quarter
and first nine months of 1996 as compared with the corresponding 1995 periods
was primarily attributable to higher average automotive finance receivables
outstanding and vehicles leased.
<BR>
<P>
     The increase in other revenues for the third quarter and first nine
months of 1996 as compared with the corresponding 1995 periods was primarily due
to the recognition of lease revenue in accordance with EITF 95-1.

</PRE>
<P>
     Costs, other than items below increased in the third quarter and first
nine months of 1996, as compared with the third quarter and first nine months of
1995, primarily as a result of a 12 percent and 14 percent increase in vehicle
shipments, respectively, and an increased proportion of truck shipments to total
vehicle shipments. In addition, Costs, other than items below for the first nine
months of 1995 include a charge of $263 million related to production changes at
the Newark assembly plant and a $115 million charge related to a voluntary
minivan owner service action. Costs, other than items below were 82 percent and
80 percent of sales of manufactured products for the third quarter and first
nine months of 1996, compared with 85 percent and 84 percent, respectively, for
the third quarter and first nine months of 1995, respectively.
<BR>
<P>
     Selling and administrative expenses for the third quarter and first
nine months of 1996 increased as compared with the corresponding 1995 periods
primarily as a result of increased profit-based employee compensation costs,
increased advertising expenses, and increased expenses associated with
Chrysler's expanding international activities.
<BR>
<P>
     Employee retirement benefits for the third quarter and first nine
months of 1996 increased as compared with the corresponding 1995 periods
primarily as a result of costs associated with a voluntary early retirement
program for certain salaried employees in the third quarter of 1996. The cost of
this voluntary early retirement program was $88 million.
<BR>
<P>
     During the second quarter of 1996, Chrysler completed the sale of ESI
and CTAS for net proceeds of $476 million. ESI and CTAS were engaged principally
in the manufacture of defense electronics and aircraft modification,
respectively, and represented substantially all of the operations of Chrysler
Technologies Corporation. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $101 million
($87 million after taxes) and is included in Costs, other than items below in
the consolidated statement of earnings for the nine months ended September 30,
1996.
<BR>
<P>
     Consistent with its strategy to focus on its core automotive business,
in the second quarter of 1996, Chrysler committed to a plan of disposal for
Thrifty. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of," a pretax loss of $65 million ($100 million after
taxes) was recognized in the second quarter of 1996 to write down Thrifty's
carrying value to estimated fair value less cost to sell. Chrysler's estimate of
the fair value of Thrifty is based principally on an analysis of non-binding
bids. The pretax loss is included in Costs, other than items below in the
consolidated statement of earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 1996.
The after-tax loss includes the effect of not being able to claim a tax
deduction for the capital loss on Chrysler's investment in Thrifty. Thrifty's
assets and liabilities at September 30, 1996 and its results of operations for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 1996 were immaterial to Chrysler's
consolidated assets and liabilities and results of operations, respectively.
Chrysler is continuing to negotiate for the sale of Thrifty and is uncertain
when the sale of Thrifty will be completed.

<CENTER><strong>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</strong></CENTER>
<P>
     Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
totaled $8.7 billion at September 30, 1996 (including $1.2 billion held by CFC
and the Car Rental Operations), compared with $8.1 billion at December 31, 1995
(including $1.2 billion held by CFC and the Car Rental Operations). The increase
in Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the
first nine months of 1996 was primarily the result of cash generated by
operating activities, marketable securities acquired in a non-cash transaction
related to the securitization of retail receivables, and net proceeds from the
sale of nonautomotive assets, partially offset by capital expenditures, net debt
repayments, common stock repurchases and dividend payments.
<BR>
<P>
     During the first quarter of 1996, Chrysler's Board of Directors
approved an increase in Chrysler's planned 1996 common stock repurchases from $1
billion to $2 billion and approved an additional $1 billion of common stock
repurchases for 1997. These common stock repurchases are subject to market and
general economic conditions. During the third quarter and the first nine months
of 1996, Chrysler repurchased 15.8 million and 51.9 million shares,
respectively, of its common stock at a cost of $452 million and $1,570 million,
respectively (including $24 million in unsettled repurchases). Share amounts
have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.
<BR>
<P>
     During the second quarter of 1996, Chrysler increased its quarterly
common dividend from $0.30 to $0.35 per common share. Dividends per common share
amounts have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.
<BR>
<P>
     At September 30, 1996, Chrysler (excluding CFC) had debt maturities
totaling $316 million through 1998. At September 30, 1996, Chrysler had a $2.4
billion revolving credit agreement which expires in April, 2001. No amounts were
outstanding under the revolving credit agreement during the third quarter of
1996. Chrysler believes that cash from operations and its cash position will be
sufficient to meet its capital expenditure, debt maturity, common stock
repurchase and other funding requirements.
<BR>
<P>
     Receivable sales continued to be a significant source of funding for
CFC, which realized $5.9 billion of net proceeds from the sale of automotive
retail receivables in the first nine months of 1996 compared with
$4.7 billion of net proceeds in the first nine months of 1995. In addition,
securitization of revolving wholesale account balances provided funding for CFC
which aggregated $5.8 billion and $6.6 billion at September 30, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.
<BR>
<P>
     At September 30, 1996, CFC had contractual debt maturities of $2.2
billion for the remainder of 1996, $2.9 billion in 1997 and $2.6 billion in
1998. CFC's U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facilities, which total $8
billion, consist of a $2 billion facility expiring in April, 1997 and a $6
billion facility expiring in April, 2001. At September 30, 1996, $3 million of
this amount was utilized. CFC believes that cash provided by operations,
receivable sales, access to term debt markets and the issuance of commercial
paper will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its debt maturity and other
funding requirements.
<BR>
<P>
     At September 30, 1996, Chrysler had a total of approximately 125,000
employees worldwide (113,000 in the U.S. and Canada). In the U.S. and Canada,
approximately 97 percent of Chrysler's hourly employees and 24 percent of its
salaried employees are represented by bargaining units. Of these represented
employees, 97 percent of hourly and 90 percent of salaried employees are
represented by the United Automotive, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement
Workers of America ("UAW") or the National Automobile, Aerospace and
Agricultural Implement Workers of Canada ("CAW"). On September 29, 1996, the UAW
and Chrysler reached an agreement on a new three-year labor contract. The
contract, which is patterned largely on the agreement reached between the UAW
and the Ford Motor Company, was ratified by the Chrysler-UAW membership. On
September 17, 1996, the CAW and Chrysler reached a new three-year labor
agreement. The contract was subsequently ratified by the Chrysler-CAW
membership. The terms of the new contracts will increase Chrysler's UAW and CAW
labor-related costs from the levels experienced under its previous
collectively-bargained labor agreements.
<BR>
<P>
     During the third quarter of 1996, CFC completed the sale of certain
nonautomotive assets for net proceeds of $225 million. During the second quarter
of 1996, Chrysler completed the sale of ESI and CTAS for net proceeds of $476
million.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler's strategy is to focus on its core automotive business. As
part of this strategy, Chrysler has sold certain assets and businesses which are
not related to its core automotive business, has committed to a plan of disposal
for Thrifty, and is exploring the sale of other such assets and businesses in
the near term.
<BR><p>
<CENTER><strong>NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD</strong></CENTER>
<P>
     In June 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
125, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities." This Statement is effective for transfers and
servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after
December 31, 1996. Chrysler believes that the implementation of this new
accounting standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated
operating results or financial position. Chrysler will adopt this accounting
standard on a prospective basis on January 1, 1997, as required.
<BR><p>
<CENTER><strong>OUTLOOK</strong></CENTER>
<P>
     The statements contained in this Outlook section are based on
management's current expectations. With the exception of the historical
information contained herein, the statements presented in this Outlook section
are forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.
Actual results may differ materially.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler's worldwide vehicle production in the third quarter of 1996
was 630,995 units, an increase of 88,139 units or 16 percent as compared with
the third quarter of 1995. Worldwide vehicle production for the fourth quarter
of 1996 is expected to be approximately 706,000 units, an increase of 7,000
units as compared with the fourth quarter of 1995. This expected production
level is heavily dependent on continued favorable economic conditions in the
U.S. and Canada, where Chrysler's sales are concentrated. A significant
weakening of Chrysler's competitive position or economic conditions in the U.S.
and Canada could result in the lowering of fourth-quarter 1996 planned
production.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler's projections for full-year 1996 retail (including fleet)
industry sales for the U.S. and Canada are 15.5 million units and 1.2 million
units, respectively. Full-year 1995 retail (including fleet) industry sales were
15.1 million units and 1.2 million units in the U.S. and Canada, respectively.
Chrysler projects that full-year 1997 retail (including fleet) industry sales
for the U.S. will range from 15.0 million to 15.5 million units and that
full-year 1997 retail (including fleet) industry sales for Canada will range
from 1.1 million to 1.2 million units. Actual levels of industry retail
(including fleet) sales will depend on, among other things, economic conditions
in the U.S. and Canada, as well as the outcome of the on-going industry labor
negotiations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Chrysler's estimates
will be accurate.
<BR>
<P>
     In addition, Chrysler wishes to caution readers that several factors,
as well as those factors described elsewhere in this discussion, or in other
Securities and Exchange Commission filings, in some cases have affected, and in
the future could affect, Chrysler's actual results and could cause Chrysler's
actual results (for the remainder of 1996 and beyond) to differ materially from
those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by, or on behalf of,
Chrysler. Those factors include: business conditions and growth in the
automotive industry and general economy; changes in consumer debt levels and
interest rates; changes in consumer preferences away from pickup trucks, sport
utility vehicles and minivans; competitive factors, such as domestic and foreign
rival car and truck offerings, sales incentives, acceptance of new products and
price pressures; excess or shortage of manufacturing capacity; risks and
uncertainties associated with Chrysler's expansion into international markets;
and changes in foreign exchange rates and the resulting impact on pricing
strategies of major foreign competitors. Additionally, many of Chrysler's
competitors have larger worldwide sales volumes and greater financial resources,
which may, over time, place Chrysler at a competitive disadvantage in responding
to substantial changes in consumer preferences, government regulations, or
adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and Canada. Finally, the automotive
industry is highly cyclical and the duration of cycles has historically been
difficult to predict.

<CENTER><strong>REVIEW BY INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS</strong></CENTER>
<P>
     Deloitte & Touche LLP, Chrysler's independent public accountants,
performed a review of the financial statements for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 1996 and 1995 in accordance with the standards for such
reviews established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
The review did not constitute an audit, and accordingly, Deloitte & Touche LLP
did not express an opinion on the aforementioned data. Refer to the Independent
Accountants' Report included at Exhibit 15A.

<P>
     This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental
Operations on an Equity Basis)," reflects the results of operations of Chrysler
with its investments in Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") and its
investments in short-term vehicle rental subsidiaries (the "Car Rental
Operations") accounted for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated
subsidiaries. This Supplemental Information does not purport to present results
of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
because it does not comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." Because the
operations of CFC and the Car Rental Operations are different in nature than
Chrysler's manufacturing operations, management believes that this disaggregated
financial data enhances an understanding of the consolidated financial
statements.

<P>
<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>Primary earnings per common share amounts were computed by
dividing earnings after deduction of preferred stock dividends by the average
number of common and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding. Computations of
primary earnings per common share exclude the effect of common stock equivalents
and shares contingently issuable for any period in which their inclusion would
have the effect of increasing the earnings per common share amount otherwise
computed. Fully diluted per common share amounts assume conversion of the
convertible preferred stock, the elimination of the related preferred stock
dividend
requirement, and the issuance of common stock for all other potentially dilutive
equivalents outstanding, unless such conversion has the effect of increasing the
earnings per common share amount otherwise computed. All per share data has been
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

<strong> INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT</strong>
<P>

</STRONG>Shareholders and Board of Directors
<BR>
Chrysler Corporation
<BR>
Auburn Hills, Michigan
<BR>
<P>
     We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Chrysler Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of September 30, 1996 and
1995 and the related consolidated statements of earnings and condensed cash
flows for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1996 and
1995. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.
<BR>
<P>
     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
<BR>
<P>
     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications
that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above
for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
<BR>
<P>
     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards, the consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Corporation and
consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented
herein); and in our report dated January 18, 1996, we expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet
as of December 31, 1995, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation
to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

<A NAME="note1">Note 1. Consolidation and Financial Statement Presentation</A>
</STRONG>
<BR>
<P>
     The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Chrysler Corporation
and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Chrysler") include the accounts of all
significant majority-owned subsidiaries and entities. Intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial
statements of Chrysler for the three and six months ended June 30, 1996 and 1995
reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring items, which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the
results for the interim periods. The operating results for the three and six
months ended June 30, 1996 are not necessarily indicative of the results of
operations for the entire year. Reference should be made to the consolidated
financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 1995. Certain amounts for 1995 have been reclassified to
conform with current period classifications.

</PRE>
<P>
<STRONG>
<A NAME="note3">Note 3. Changes in Accounting Principles</A>
</STRONG>
<BR>
<P>
     Effective January 1, 1996, Chrysler adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The adoption of
this new accounting standard did not have a material impact on Chrysler's
consolidated operating results or financial position. Also see <A HREF="notes.html#note8">Note 8.</A>
<BR>
<P>
     Effective January 1, 1995, Chrysler changed its accounting treatment
for vehicle sales for which Chrysler conditionally guarantees the minimum resale
value of the vehicles in accordance with the consensus reached on Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue 95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed
Minimum
Resale Value." In accordance with the consensus, these vehicle sales are
accounted for as operating leases with the related revenues and costs deferred
at the time of shipment. A portion of the deferred revenues and costs is
recognized over the corresponding guarantee period, with the remainder
recognized at the end of the guarantee period. The average guarantee period for
these vehicles is approximately nine months. Implementation of this accounting
change resulted in the recognition of an after-tax charge of $96 million, or
$0.13 per common share, for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle. Previously reported results for the six months ended June 30, 1995
have been restated to reflect the cumulative effect of this accounting
change.
<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>
<A NAME="note4">Note 4. Two-For-One Stock Split</A>
</STRONG>
<BR>
<P>
     On May 16, 1996, Chrysler's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
stock split to be effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to be
distributed on July 15, 1996 to shareholders of record on June 15, 1996. All per
share data and the average common and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding
have been
adjusted to reflect this stock split for all periods presented. The number of
common shares issued, outstanding and held in treasury as of June 30, 1996 have
been adjusted to reflect this stock split. In addition, the par value of the new
shares issued as a result of the two-for-one stock split has been transferred
from additional paid-in capital to common stock. Additional paid-in capital,
common stock balances, common shares issued, outstanding and held in treasury
for prior periods have not been restated for the two-for-one stock split.
<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>
<A NAME="note5">Note 5. Common Stock Repurchases</A>
</STRONG>
<BR>
<P>
     During the first quarter of 1996, Chrysler's Board of Directors
approved an increase in Chrysler's planned 1996 common stock repurchases from $1
billion to $2 billion and approved an additional $1 billion of common stock
repurchases for 1997. These common stock repurchases are subject to market and
general economic conditions. During the second quarter and first six months of
1996, Chrysler repurchased 24.4 million and 36.1 million shares, respectively,
of its common stock at a cost of $786 million and $1,118 million, respectively
(including $32 million in unsettled repurchases). Share amounts have been
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.
<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>
<A NAME="note6">Note 6. Sale of Defense Electronics and Airborne Systems Units</A>
</STRONG>
<BR>
<P>
     On June 14, 1996, Chrysler completed the sale of Electrospace Systems,
Inc. ("ESI") and Chrysler Technologies Airborne Systems, Inc. ("CTAS"), for net
proceeds of $476 million. ESI and CTAS are engaged principally in the
manufacture of defense electronics and aircraft modification, respectively, and
represent substantially all of the operations of Chrysler Technologies
Corporation. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $101 million ($87 million
after taxes) and is included in Costs, other than items below in the
consolidated statement of earnings.
<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>
<A NAME="note7">Note 7. Plant Provision</A>
</STRONG>
<BR>
<P>
     The results of operations for the second quarter and first six months
of 1995 include a $232 million provision ($143 million after taxes) for costs
associated with production changes at the Newark assembly plant. The provision
reflects the recognition of supplemental unemployment benefits, job security
benefits and other related employee costs, and the write-down of certain
equipment and tooling. The provision is included in Costs, other than items
below in the consolidated statement of earnings.
<BR>
<P>
<STRONG>
<A NAME="note8">Note 8. Loss on Assets to Be Sold</A>
</STRONG>
<BR>
<P>
     Consistent with its strategy to focus on its core automotive business,
Chrysler has committed to a plan of disposal for Thrifty Rent-A-Car System, Inc.
("Thrifty") and is currently reviewing preliminary non-binding bids. In
accordance with SFAS No. 121, assets to be disposed of should be reported at the
lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. As a result, a pretax
loss of $65 million ($100 million after taxes) was recognized in the second
quarter of 1996. The pretax loss is included in Costs, other than items below in
the consolidated statement of earnings. The after-tax loss includes the effect
of not being able to claim a tax deduction for the capital loss on Chrysler's
investment in Thrifty. Chrysler's assessment of the fair value of Thrifty was
based principally on an analysis of the preliminary non-binding bids. Thrifty's
assets and liabilities at June 30, 1996 were not material to Chrysler's
consolidated assets and liabilities. Thrifty's results of operations for the
three and six months ended June 30, 1996 were immaterial to Chrysler's
consolidated results of operations. The sale of Thrifty is expected to be
completed by the end of 1996.

<P>
     Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes and the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle of $1,720 million for the second
quarter of 1996, compared with $238 million for the second quarter of 1995. For
the first six months of 1996, Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes and
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $3,390 million,
compared with $1,208 million for the first six months of 1995. Net earnings for
the second quarter of 1996 were $1,037 million, or $1.39 per common share,
compared with $135 million, or $0.17 per common share, for the second quarter of
1995. Net earnings for the first six months of 1996 were $2,042 million, or
$2.70 per common share, compared with $631 million, or $0.83 per common share,
for the first six months of 1995.
<BR>
<P>
     Earnings for the second quarter and first six months of 1996 include a
gain of $101 million ($87 million after taxes) from the sale of Electrospace
Systems, Inc. ("ESI") and Chrysler Technologies Airborne Systems, Inc. ("CTAS"),
and a charge of $65 million ($100 million after taxes) related to a write-down
of Thrifty Rent-A-Car System, Inc. ("Thrifty"). Earnings for the second quarter
and first six months of 1995 include a $232 million charge ($143 million after
taxes) for costs associated with production changes at Chrysler's Newark
assembly plant. Earnings for the first six months of 1995 include a charge of
$115 million ($71 million after taxes) for a voluntary minivan owner service
action. Net earnings for the first six months of 1995 include a charge of $96
million, or $0.13 per common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle related to the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task
Force ("EITF") 95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed Minimum
Resale Value."

<P>
     Excluding the items listed above, the improvement in operating results
in the second quarter and first six months of 1996 as compared with the second
quarter and first six months of 1995 resulted primarily from an increase in
shipments and a reduction in average sales incentives per vehicle. The increase
in shipments was primarily due to increased shipments of minivans and Dodge Ram
pickup trucks. Minivan shipments in the second quarter and first six months of
1995 were adversely affected by the changeover and launch of Chrysler's
all-new minivans. The increase in shipments of Dodge Ram pickup trucks in the
second quarter and first six months of 1996 primarily reflects production at two
additional facilities.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler's worldwide shipments in the second quarter and first six
months of 1996 were 801,769 units and 1,554,945 units, respectively, compared
with 635,151 units and 1,349,916 units, respectively, in the second quarter and
first six months of 1995.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler's revenues and results of operations are principally derived
from the U.S. and Canada automotive marketplaces. In the second quarter of 1996,
retail sales of new cars and trucks in the U.S. and
Canada, on a Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate basis, were 16.7 million units,
compared with 15.9 million units for the second quarter of 1995, an increase of
5 percent.

     Chrysler's U.S. car market share increased in the second quarter and
first six months of 1996 primarily as a result of increased sales of its midsize
sedans and coupes, including the new Plymouth Breeze and Chrysler Sebring
convertible. The increase in Chrysler's U.S. truck market share for the second
quarter and first six months of 1996 primarily reflects increased sales of its
Dodge Ram pickup trucks and minivans.

     Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") reported pretax earnings of $155
million for the second quarter of 1996 as compared with $127 million for the
second quarter of 1995. For the first six months of 1996, CFC reported pretax
earnings of $309 million as compared with $236 million for the first six months
of 1995. CFC's net earnings for the second quarter and first six months of 1996
were $101 million and $199 million, respectively, as compared with $86 million
and $155 million for the second quarter and first six months of 1995. The
increase in net earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 1996 as
compared with the corresponding 1995 periods primarily reflects higher average
receivables outstanding, net margin improvements due to lower effective
borrowing costs and higher gains from increased receivable sales.

<P>
     The increase in sales of manufactured products in the second quarter of
1996 as compared with the second quarter of 1995 primarily reflects a 26 percent
increase in vehicle shipments and an increase in average revenue per unit, net
of sales incentives, from $18,198 in the second quarter of 1995 to $18,649 in
the second quarter of 1996. The increase in sales of manufactured products in
the first six months of 1996 as compared with the first six months of 1995
primarily reflects a 15 percent increase in vehicle shipments and an increase in
average revenue per unit, net of sales incentives, from $17,964 in the first six
months of 1995 to $18,604 in the first six months of 1996. The increase in
average revenue per unit in the second quarter and first six months of 1996 was
principally due to pricing actions and a decrease in average sales incentives
per unit.
<BR>
<P>
     The increase in other revenues for the second quarter and first six
months of 1996 as compared with the corresponding 1995 periods was primarily due
to the recognition of lease revenue in accordance with EITF 95-1.

<P>
     Costs, other than items below increased in the second quarter and first
six months of 1996, as compared with the second quarter and first six months of
1995, primarily as a result of a 26 percent and 15 percent increase in vehicle
shipments, respectively. Costs, other than items below for the second quarter
and first six months of 1995 include a charge of $232 million related to
production changes at the Newark assembly plant.
Costs, other than items below for the first six months of 1995 include a $115
million provision related to a voluntary minivan owner service action. Costs,
other than items below were 79 percent of sales of manufactured products for
both the second quarter and first six months of 1996, compared with 86 percent
and 84 percent for the second quarter and first six months of 1995,
respectively.
<BR>
<P>
     Selling and administrative expenses for the second quarter and first
six months of 1996 increased as compared with the corresponding 1995 periods
primarily as a result of increased profit-based employee compensation costs and
advertising expenses.
<BR>
<P>
     Employee retirement benefits for the second quarter and first six
months of 1996 were comparable to the corresponding 1995 periods. Employee
retirement benefits in the third quarter of 1996 are expected to increase as
compared with the third quarter of 1995 primarily as a result of costs
associated with a voluntary early retirement program offered to certain salaried
employees in the third quarter of 1996. The cost of this voluntary early
retirement program is estimated to be $50 million to $100 million, depending
primarily on the number of employees accepting the early retirement offer.
<BR>
<P>
     During the second quarter of 1996, Chrysler completed the sale of ESI
and CTAS for net proceeds of $476 million. ESI and CTAS are engaged principally
in the manufacture of defense electronics and aircraft modification,
respectively, and represent substantially all of the operations of Chrysler
Technologies Corporation. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $101 million
($87 million after taxes) and is included in Costs, other than items below in
the consolidated statement of earnings.
<BR>
<P>
     Consistent with its strategy to focus on its core automotive business,
Chrysler has committed to a plan of disposal for Thrifty and is currently
reviewing preliminary non-binding bids. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," assets to be
disposed of should be reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less
cost to sell. As a result, a pretax loss of $65 million ($100 million after
taxes) was recognized in the second quarter of 1996. The pretax loss is included
in Costs, other than items below in the consolidated statement of earnings. The
after-tax loss includes the effect of not being able to claim a tax deduction
for the capital loss on Chrysler's investment in Thrifty. Chrysler's assessment
of the fair value of Thrifty was based principally on an analysis of the
preliminary non-binding bids. Thrifty's assets and liabilities at June 30, 1996
were not material to Chrysler's consolidated assets and liabilities. Thrifty's
results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 1996 were
immaterial to Chrysler's consolidated results of operations. The sale of Thrifty
is expected to be completed by the end of 1996.

<P>
     Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
totaled $8.8 billion at June 30, 1996 (including $1.2 billion held by CFC and
the Car Rental Operations), compared with $8.1 billion at December 31, 1995
(including $1.2 billion held by CFC and the Car Rental Operations). The increase
in Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the
first six months of 1996 was primarily the result of cash generated by operating
activities, marketable securities acquired in a non-cash transaction related to
the securitization of retail receivables, and net proceeds from the sale of ESI
and CTAS, partially offset by capital expenditures, net debt repayments, common
stock repurchases and dividend payments.
<BR>
<P>
     During the first quarter of 1996, Chrysler's Board of Directors
approved an increase in Chrysler's planned 1996 common stock repurchases from $1
billion to $2 billion and approved an additional $1 billion of common stock
repurchases for 1997. These common stock repurchases are subject to market and
general economic conditions. During the second quarter and the first six months
of 1996, Chrysler repurchased 24.4 million and 36.1 million shares,
respectively, of its common stock at a cost of $786 million and $1,118 million,
respectively (including $32 million in unsettled repurchases). Share amounts
have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.
<BR>
<P>
     During the second quarter of 1996, Chrysler increased its quarterly
common dividend from $0.30 to $0.35 per common share. Dividends per common share
amounts have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.
<BR>
<P>
     At June 30, 1996, Chrysler (excluding CFC) had debt maturities totaling
$318 million through 1998. During the second quarter of 1996, Chrysler replaced
its existing $1.7 billion revolving credit agreement, which was to expire in
July 1999, with a new $2.4 billion revolving credit agreement expiring in April
2001. No amounts were outstanding under either revolving credit agreement during
the second quarter of 1996. Chrysler believes that cash from operations and its
cash position will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure, debt maturity,
common stock repurchase and other funding requirements.
<BR>
<P>
     Receivable sales continued to be a significant source of funding for
CFC, which realized $4.7 billion of net proceeds from the sale of automotive
retail receivables in the first six months of 1996 compared with $3.2 billion of
net proceeds in the first six months of 1995. In addition, securitization of
revolving wholesale account balances provided funding for CFC which aggregated
$6.6 billion and $7.3 billion at June 30, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
<BR>
<P>
     During the second quarter of 1996, CFC entered into new revolving
credit facilities which replaced its existing U.S. and Canadian credit
facilities. The new facilities, which total $8 billion, consist of a $2 billion
facility expiring in April 1997 and a $6 billion facility expiring in April
2001. As of June 30, 1996, $10 million of this amount was utilized.
<BR>
<P>
     At June 30, 1996, CFC had contractual debt maturities of $2.3 billion
for the remainder of 1996, $2.9 billion in 1997 and $2.5 billion in 1998. CFC
believes that cash provided by operations, receivable sales, access to term debt
markets and the issuance of commercial paper will provide sufficient liquidity
to meet its debt maturity and other funding requirements.
<BR>
<P>
     During the second quarter of 1996, Chrysler completed the sale of ESI
and CTAS for net proceeds of $476 million.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler's strategy is to focus on its core automotive business. As
part of this strategy, Chrysler has sold certain assets and businesses which are
not related to its core automotive business, has committed to a plan of disposal
for Thrifty, and is exploring the sale of other such assets and businesses in
the near term.
<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><H4><A NAME="account">NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD</A></H4></CENTER>
<BR>
<P>
     In June 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 125, "Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities." This
Statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities occurring after December 31, 1996. Chrysler has
not determined the impact that the adoption of this accounting standard will
have on its consolidated operating results or financial position. Chrysler will
adopt this accounting standard on January 1, 1997, as required.
<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><H4><A NAME="outlook">OUTLOOK</A></H4></CENTER>
<BR>
<P>
     The statements contained in this Outlook section are based on
management's current expectations. With the exception of the historical
information contained herein, the statements presented in this Outlook section
are forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.
Actual results may differ materially.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler's worldwide vehicle production in the second quarter of 1996
was 775,797 units, an increase of 181,371 units or 31 percent as compared with
the second quarter of 1995. Worldwide vehicle production for the third quarter
of 1996 is expected to be approximately 608,100 units, an increase of
approximately 65,200 units or 12 percent as compared with the third quarter of
1995. This expected production level is heavily dependent on continued favorable
economic conditions in the U.S. and Canada, where Chrysler's sales are
concentrated. A significant weakening of economic conditions in the U.S. and
Canada or an interruption in production as a result of labor disputes could
result in the lowering of third-quarter 1996 planned production.
<BR>
<P>
     Chrysler's projections for full-year 1996 retail (including fleet)
industry sales for the U.S. and Canada are 15.5 million units and 1.2 million
units, respectively. Full-year 1995 retail (including fleet) industry sales were
15.1 million units and 1.2 million units in the U.S. and Canada, respectively.
Actual levels of industry retail (including fleet) sales will depend on, among
other things, economic conditions in the U.S. and Canada as well as the outcome
of the 1996 labor negotiations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
Chrysler's estimates will be accurate.
<BR>
<P>
     At June 30, 1996, Chrysler had a total of approximately 128,000
employees worldwide (117,000 in the U.S. and Canada). In the U.S. and Canada,
approximately 95 percent of Chrysler's hourly employees and 23 percent of its
salaried employees are represented by bargaining units. The existing national
agreements with Chrysler's principal U.S. and Canadian bargaining units will
expire in September 1996. While Chrysler negotiated its current labor agreements
without an interruption in production in 1993, it cannot predict whether
satisfactory agreements can be negotiated with its principal bargaining units in
1996 without an interruption in production. An interruption in production could
have a material adverse effect on Chrysler's consolidated operating results.
<BR>
<P>
     In addition, Chrysler wishes to caution readers that several factors,
as well as those factors described elsewhere in this discussion, or in other
Securities and Exchange Commission filings, in some cases have affected, and in
the future could affect, Chrysler's actual results and could cause Chrysler's
actual results for the remainder of 1996 and beyond to differ materially from
those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by, or on behalf of,
Chrysler. Those factors include: business conditions and growth in the
automotive industry and general economy; changes in consumer debt levels and
interest rates; changes in consumer preferences away from pickup trucks, sport
utility vehicles and minivans; competitive factors, such as domestic and foreign
rival car and truck offerings, sales incentives, acceptance of new products and
price pressures; excess or shortage of manufacturing capacity; and changes in
foreign exchange rates and the resulting impact on pricing strategies of major
foreign competitors. Additionally, many of Chrysler's competitors have larger
worldwide sales volumes and greater financial resources, which may, over time,
place Chrysler at a competitive disadvantage in responding to substantial
changes in consumer preferences, government regulations, or adverse economic
conditions in the U.S. and Canada. Finally, the automotive industry is highly
cyclical and the duration of cycles has historically been difficult to
predict.

<P>

     Deloitte & Touche LLP, Chrysler's independent public accountants,
performed a review of the financial statements for the three and six months
ended June 30, 1996 and 1995 in accordance with the standards for such reviews
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The
review did not constitute an audit, and accordingly, Deloitte & Touche LLP did
not express an opinion on the aforementioned data. Refer to the Independent
Accountants' Report included at Exhibit 15A.

     Three of the four previously reported purported class action lawsuits
that alleged defects in the antilock braking system used in certain model year
vehicles (see page 16 of the 1995 Annual Report on Form 10-K) were voluntarily
dismissed, and one additional purported class action containing similar
allegations was filed. Chrysler has announced a recall involving the repair of
the antilock braking system on those vehicles.

<P>
     This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental
Operations on an Equity Basis)," reflects the results of operations of Chrysler
with its investments in Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") and its
investments in short-term vehicle rental subsidiaries (the "Car Rental
Operations") accounted for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated
subsidiaries. This Supplemental Information does not purport to present results
of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
because it does not comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." Because the
operations of CFC and the Car Rental Operations are different in nature than
Chrysler's manufacturing operations, management believes that this disaggregated
financial data enhances an understanding of the consolidated financial
statements.

     This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental
Operations on an Equity Basis)," reflects the financial position of Chrysler
with its investments in CFC and the Car Rental Operations accounted for on an
equity basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries. This Supplemental
Information does not purport to present financial position in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles because it does not comply with SFAS
No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." The financial
covenant contained in Chrysler's revolving credit facility is based on this
Supplemental Information. In
addition, because the operations of CFC and the Car Rental Operations are
different in nature than Chrysler's manufacturing operations, management
believes that this disaggregated financial data enhances an understanding of the
consolidated financial statements.

<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Primary earnings per common share amounts were computed by
dividing earnings after deduction of preferred stock dividends by the average
number of common and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding. Computations of
primary earnings per common share exclude the effect of common stock equivalents
and shares contingently issuable for any period in which their inclusion would
have the effect of increasing the earnings per common share amount otherwise
computed. Fully diluted per common share amounts assume conversion of the
convertible preferred stock, the elimination of the related preferred stock
dividend requirement, and the issuance of common stock for all other potentially
dilutive equivalents outstanding, unless such conversion has the effect of
increasing the earnings per common share amount otherwise computed. All per
share data has been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

<P>
<STRONG>
</STRONG>Shareholders and Board of Directors
<BR>
Chrysler Corporation
<BR>
Auburn Hills, Michigan
<BR>
<P>
     We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Chrysler Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of June 30, 1996 and 1995
and the related consolidated statements of earnings and condensed cash flows for
the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 1996 and 1995. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
<BR>
<P>
     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
<BR>
<P>
     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications
that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above
for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
<BR>
<P>
     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards, the consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Corporation and
consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented
herein); and in our report dated January 18, 1996, we expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the
information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet
as of December 31, 1995, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation
to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring items, which

are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the

results for the interim periods. The operating results for the three months

ended March 31, 1996 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations

for the entire year. Reference should be made to the consolidated financial

statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 1995. Certain amounts for 1995 have been reclassified to conform

with current period classifications.

<strong>Note 3. Changes in Accounting Principles</strong>

<P>

     Effective January 1, 1996, Chrysler adopted Statement of Financial

Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of

Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The

implementation of this new accounting standard did not have a material impact on

Chrysler's consolidated operating results or financial position.

<BR>

<P>

     Effective January 1, 1995, Chrysler changed its accounting treatment

for vehicle sales for which Chrysler conditionally guarantees the minimum resale

value of the vehicles in accordance with the consensus reached on Emerging

Issues Task Force Issue 95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed

Minimum

Resale Value." In accordance with the consensus, these vehicle sales are

accounted for as operating leases with the related revenues and costs deferred

at the time of shipment. A portion of the deferred revenues and costs is

recognized over the corresponding guarantee period, with the remainder

recognized at the end of the guarantee period. The average guarantee period for

these vehicles is approximately nine months. Implementation of this accounting

change resulted in the recognition of an after-tax charge of $96 million, or

$0.26 per common share, for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting

principle. Chrysler's first-quarter 1995 consolidated financial statements have

been restated to reflect this accounting change.

<BR>

<p>

<strong>Note 4. Common Stock Repurchases</strong>

<P>

     During the first quarter of 1996, Chrysler's Board of Directors

approved an increase in Chrysler's planned 1996 common stock repurchases from $1

billion to $2 billion and approved an additional $1 billion of common stock

repurchases for 1997. These common stock repurchases are subject to market and

general economic conditions. During the first quarter of 1996, Chrysler

repurchased 5.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $332 million

(including $27 million in unsettled repurchases).

<BR><p>







<strong>Note 5. Subsequent Event</strong>

<P>

     On April 4, 1996, Chrysler entered into an agreement to sell

substantially all of the operations of Chrysler Technologies Corporation

("CTC"). Under the sale agreement, Chrysler will receive a sale price of $455

million and a dividend of $20 million, for a total of $475 million. CTC, a

wholly owned subsidiary of Chrysler, engages principally in aircraft

modification and the manufacture of electronics products and systems. The sale,

which is subject to federal regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in

the second quarter of 1996. In addition, the sale is expected to result in a

pretax gain of approximately $100 million.

<H3>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</H3>

<P>

     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction

with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

<BR>



<CENTER><H4><A NAME="Financial">FINANCIAL REVIEW</A></H4></CENTER>

<P>

     Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes and the cumulative

effect of a change in accounting principle of $1,670 million for the first

quarter of 1996, compared with $970 million for the first quarter of 1995. Net

earnings for the first quarter of 1996 were $1,005 million, or $2.64 per common

share, compared with $496 million, or $1.33 per common share, in the first

quarter of 1995. Fully diluted earnings per share were $2.61 in the first

quarter of 1996 as compared with $1.23 in the first quarter of 1995. Net

earnings for the first quarter of 1995 included a charge of $96 million, or

$0.26 per common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting

principle related to the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed Minimum Resale Value."

<BR>

<P>

     The improvement in operating results in the first quarter of 1996 as

compared with the first quarter of 1995 resulted primarily from a 5 percent

increase in shipments and an increased proportion of higher-margin truck

(including minivan) shipments. In addition, operating results for the first

quarter of 1995 included the unfavorable effects of costs associated with the

model changeover and launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans and a $115 million

pretax charge for costs associated with a voluntary minivan owner service

action.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's worldwide shipments in the first quarter of 1996 were

225,261 cars and 527,915 trucks (including minivans), compared with 280,969 cars

and 433,796 trucks (including minivans) in the first quarter of 1995.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's revenues and results of operations are principally derived

from the U.S. and Canada automotive marketplaces. In the first quarter of 1996,

retail sales of new cars and trucks in the U.S. and Canada, on a Seasonally

Adjusted Annual Rate basis, were 16.8 million units, compared with 16.5 million

units for the first quarter of 1995.

     Chrysler's U.S. and combined U.S. and Canada retail sales and market

<BR>

<P>

     The increase in Chrysler's U.S. truck market share for the first

quarter of 1996 as compared with the first quarter of 1995 primarily reflects an

increase in minivan and Dodge Ram pickup truck sales.

<BR>

<P>

     Pretax earnings of Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") for the first

quarter of 1996 and 1995 were $154 million and $109 million, respectively. CFC's

net earnings were $98 million for the first quarter of 1996, compared with $69

million for the first quarter of 1995. The increase in net earnings for the

first quarter of

1996 compared with the first quarter of 1995 primarily reflects improved lending

margins and higher average automotive finance receivables outstanding.

     The increase in sales of manufactured products in the first quarter of

increase in shipments and an increase in average revenue per unit, net of sales

incentives, from $17,758 in the first quarter of 1995 to $18,559 in the first

quarter of 1996. The increase in average revenue per unit was principally due to

pricing actions and an increased proportion of truck shipments to total vehicle

shipments.



<P>

     The increase in finance and insurance revenues in the first quarter of

1996 as compared with the first quarter of 1995 was primarily attributable to

higher average automotive finance receivables outstanding and vehicles

leased.

<P>

     Costs, other than items below increased in the first quarter of 1996 as

manufactured products were 78 percent and 82 percent for the three months ended

March 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.



<P>

     Depreciation and special tools amortization for the first quarter of

1996 increased as compared with the first quarter of 1995 primarily as a result

of higher levels of property and equipment in use.



<P>

     Selling and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 1996

increased as compared with the first quarter of 1995 primarily as a result of

costs associated with the settlement of a shareholder matter, increased

international activities and increased advertising.



<P>

     The increase in interest expense for the first quarter of 1996 as

compared with the first quarter of 1995 was primarily due to higher average

borrowings, offset in part, by lower average borrowing rates at CFC. CFC's

average effective cost of borrowings was 7.1 percent and 7.9 percent in the

first quarter of 1996 and 1995, respectively.

<P>

     Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

totaled $8.3 billion at March 31, 1996 (including $1.2 billion held by CFC and

Car Rental Operations), compared with $8.1 billion at December 31, 1995

(including $1.2 billion held by CFC and Car Rental Operations). The increase in

Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the

first quarter of 1996 was primarily the result of cash generated by operating

activities and cash provided by a net increase in total debt, partially offset

by capital expenditures, net finance receivables acquired, common stock

repurchases and dividend payments.



<P>

     During the first quarter of 1996, Chrysler's Board of Directors

approved an increase in Chrysler's planned 1996 common stock repurchases from $1

billion to $2 billion and approved an additional $1 billion of common stock

repurchases for 1997. These common stock repurchases are subject to market and

general economic conditions. During the first quarter of 1996, Chrysler

repurchased 5.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $332 million

(including $27 million in unsettled repurchases).



<P>

     At March 31, 1996, Chrysler (excluding CFC), had debt maturities

totaling $335 million through 1998. At March 31, 1996, Chrysler had a $1.7

billion revolving credit agreement which expires in July 1999. There were no

amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement at March 31, 1996.

During the first quarter of 1996, Chrysler began the process of negotiating a

new revolving credit agreement to replace its existing revolving credit

agreement. Chrysler believes that cash from operations and its cash position

will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure, debt maturity, common stock

repurchase and other funding requirements.



<P>

     Receivable sales continued to be a significant source of funding for

CFC, which realized $1.1 billion of net proceeds from the sale of automotive

retail receivables in the first quarter of 1996 compared with $1.4 billion of

net proceeds in the first quarter of 1995. In addition, securitization of

revolving wholesale account balances provided funding for CFC which aggregated

$6.6 billion and $5.8 billion at March 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.



<P>

     CFC's U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facilities, which total $8.0

billion, consist of a $2.4 billion facility expiring in May 1996 and a $5.6

billion facility expiring in May 2000. At March 31, 1996, $3 million was

outstanding under CFC's revolving credit facilities. During the first quarter of

1996, CFC began the process of negotiating new revolving credit facilities to

replace its existing revolving credit facilities.



<P>

     At March 31, 1996, CFC had contractual debt maturities of $3.5 billion

for the remainder of 1996, $2.9 billion in 1997 and $2.5 billion in 1998. CFC

believes that cash provided by operations, receivable sales, access to term debt

markets and the issuance of commercial paper will provide sufficient liquidity

to meet its debt maturity and other funding requirements.



<P>

     On April 4, 1996, Chrysler entered into an agreement to sell

substantially all of the operations of Chrysler Technologies Corporation

("CTC"). Under the sale agreement, Chrysler will receive a sale price of $455

million and a dividend of $20 million, for a total of $475 million. CTC, a

wholly owned subsidiary of Chrysler, engages principally in aircraft

modification and the manufacture of electronics products and systems. The sale,

which is subject to federal regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in

the second quarter of 1996. In addition, the sale is expected to result in a

pretax gain of approximately $100 million.



<P>

     Chrysler's strategy is to focus on its core automotive business. As

part of this strategy, Chrysler has sold certain assets and businesses which are

not related to its core automotive business, and is exploring the sale of other

such assets and businesses in the near term.

<P>

     Deloitte & Touche LLP, Chrysler's independent public accountants,

performed a review of the financial statements for the three months ended March

31, 1996 and 1995 in accordance with the standards for such reviews established

by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The review did not

constitute an audit, and accordingly, Deloitte & Touche LLP did not express an

opinion on the aforementioned data. Refer to the Independent Accountants' Report

included at Exhibit 15A.

<H3>Item 1. Legal Proceedings</H3>

</STRONG>

<BR>

<P>

     In December 1990 and January 1991, eight class action lawsuits were

commenced by separate plaintiffs against Chrysler and certain of its directors

in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for New Castle County,

Delaware. The Complaints in these suits were very similar and alleged that the

directors breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders by amending Chrysler's

Share Purchase Rights Plan in a manner designed to entrench themselves in office

and to impair the right of stockholders to avail themselves of offers to

purchase their shares by an acquiror not favored by management. On June 6, 1995,

Chrysler entered into a Memorandum of Understanding which contemplated

settlement of the litigation. The Memorandum was subject to several conditions,

including satisfactory completion of discovery as to the fairness of the

proposed settlement. The settlement was subject to Court approval. The

Memorandum also contemplated that the settlement, if approved, would consist of

Chrysler's action in December 1994 further amending its Rights Plan. A

Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release was filed with

the Court on December 7, 1995. A notice of pendency of the lawsuit, the proposed

settlement, and of a settlement hearing and right to appear was sent to

stockholders in accordance with the order of the Court. The settlement hearing

was held on February 23, 1996, and the Court approved the settlement and

dismissed the lawsuit.

<BR>

<P>

     In April 1995, thirty four class action lawsuits were commenced by

separate plaintiffs against Chrysler, certain of its current and former

directors and, in some cases, Tracinda Corporation, a holding company wholly

owned by Kirk Kerkorian and the beneficial owner of more than 13% of the

outstanding common stock of Chrysler as of December 31, 1995, and its

affiliates, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for New Castle

County, Delaware. The Complaints in these suits fall into two general

categories: (a) those which allege that the directors breached their fiduciary

duties to stockholders by failing to negotiate with Tracinda regarding its

proposal to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Chrysler not then owned by

it; and (b) those which allege that the directors breached their fiduciary

duties to stockholders by contemplating, planning and/or effecting Tracinda's

proposal at a time when the market price of Chrysler's stock was depressed and

did not reflect its true value. The Complaints in the former category ask for,

among other things, (a) an injunction or an order obligating the Board of

Directors to undertake an evaluation of alternatives, including measures with

respect to Chrysler's Rights Plan, designed to maximize shareholder value, (b) a

declaration that the defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to the

plaintiffs, (c) compensatory damages and interest, and (d) costs and fees. The

Complaints in the latter category ask for, among other things, (a) a declaration

that the transaction proposed by Tracinda is unfair, unjust and inequitable, (b)

an injunction against implementation of the transaction proposed by Tracinda and

any improper device which impedes maximization of shareholder value, (c) damages

and interest, (d) costs and fees, and (e) such other relief as may be just and

proper. Nineteen of these actions have subsequently been dismissed without

prejudice by the plaintiffs.

     This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental

Operations on an Equity Basis)," reflects the results of operations of Chrysler

with its investments in Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") and its

investments in short-term vehicle rental subsidiaries (the "Car Rental

Operations") accounted for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated

subsidiaries. This Supplemental Information does not purport to present results

of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

because it does not comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

("SFAS") No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." Because the

operations of CFC and the Car Rental Operations are different in nature than

Chrysler's manufacturing operations, management believes that this disaggregated

financial data enhances an understanding of the consolidated financial

statements.

     This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental

Operations on an Equity Basis)," reflects the financial position of Chrysler

with its investments in CFC and the Car Rental Operations accounted for on an

equity basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries. This Supplemental

Information does not purport to present financial position in accordance with

generally accepted accounting principles because it does not comply with SFAS

No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." The financial

covenant contained in Chrysler's revolving credit facility is based on this

Supplemental Information. In

addition, because the operations of CFC and the Car Rental Operations are

different in nature than Chrysler's manufacturing operations, management

believes that this disaggregated financial data enhances an understanding of the

consolidated financial statements.

<P>

NOTE: Primary earnings per common share amounts were computed by dividing

          earnings after deduction of preferred stock dividends by the average

          number of common and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding.

          Computations of primary earnings per common share exclude the effect

          of common stock equivalents and shares contingently issuable for any

          period in which their inclusion would have the effect of increasing

          the earnings per common share amount otherwise computed. Fully diluted

          per common share amounts assume conversion of the convertible

          preferred stock, the elimination of the

          related preferred stock dividend requirement, and the issuance of

          common stock for all other potentially dilutive equivalent shares

          outstanding.

<P>

     We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of

Chrysler Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 1996 and 1995

and the related consolidated statements of earnings and condensed cash flows for

the three-month period ended March 31, 1996 and 1995. These financial statements

are the responsibility of the Company's management.

<BR>

<P>

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the

American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim

financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to

financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and

accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in

accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is

the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a

whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

<BR>

<P>

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications

that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above

for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

<BR>

<P>

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted

auditing standards, the consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Corporation and

consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, and the related consolidated

statements of earnings and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented

herein); and in our report dated January 18, 1996, we expressed an unqualified

opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the

information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet

as of December 31, 1995, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation

to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

<H3>Note 1. Consolidation and Financial Statement Presentation<p></h3>

     The consolidated financial statements of Chrysler Corporation and its

consolidated subsidiaries ("Chrysler") include the accounts of all significant

majority-owned subsidiaries and entities. Intercompany accounts and transactions

have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited consolidated financial

statements of Chrysler for the three and six months ended June 30, 1995 and 1994

reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring items, which

are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the

results for the interim periods. The operating results for the three and six

months ended June 30, 1995 are not necessarily indicative of the results of

operations for the entire year. Reference should be made to the consolidated

financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year

ended December 31, 1994. Amounts for 1994 have been reclassified to conform with

current period classifications.

<H3><A NAME="008">Note 3. Changes in Accounting Principles</A></H3>

<P>

     Effective January 1, 1995, Chrysler adopted Statement of Financial

Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment

of a Loan" and SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan

-- Income Recognition and Disclosures." These new accounting standards require

creditors to evaluate the collectibility of both contractual interest and

principal of receivables when evaluating the need for a loss accrual. The

implementation of these new accounting standards did not have a material impact

on Chrysler's consolidated operating results or financial position.

<BR>

<H3><A NAME="009">Note 4. Sales of Automotive Assets and Investments</A></H3>

<P>

     Chrysler sold its wiring harness operations and certain of its soft

trim operations in the first and second quarters of 1994, respectively, and

entered into long-term supply agreements with each of the purchasers. Aggregate

net proceeds from the sales and the supply agreements were $315 million. The

related pretax gains of $254 million were deferred and are being recognized over

the periods of the respective supply agreements.

<BR>

<H3><A NAME="010">Note 5. Preferred Stock Conversion and Supplementary Earnings Per Share Data</A></H3>

<P>

     During the second quarter and the first six months of 1995, holders of

the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converted 699,575 and 1,469,172 shares,

respectively, of preferred stock into 19.4 and 40.8 million shares of common

stock, respectively. Primary earnings per common share for the second quarter

and the first six months of 1995 were calculated based upon a weighted average

of common shares outstanding which included the additional shares from the

preferred stock conversions. If all of the preferred stock conversions had

occurred on January 1, 1995, primary earnings per common share for the first six

months of 1995 would have been $1.83.

<BR>

<H3><A NAME="011">Note 6. Common Stock Repurchase</A></H3>

<P>

     In December 1994, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion

common stock repurchase program, subject to market and business conditions.

During the second quarter and the first six months of 1995, Chrysler repurchased

5.5 and 14.1 million shares, respectively, of its common stock under this

program at a cost of $239 and $608 million, respectively.

<BR>

<H3><A NAME="012">Note 7. Tracinda Corporation Tender Offer</A></H3>

<P>

     On April 12, 1995, Tracinda Corporation ("Tracinda"), which owned

approximately 10 percent of the outstanding common stock of Chrysler, sent

Chrysler a letter proposing to acquire the remaining 90 percent of Chrysler's

common stock at $55 per share. After a thorough and careful review, Chrysler's

Board of Directors unanimously rejected the leveraged buy-out proposal. Tracinda

formally withdrew its $55 per share offer on May 31, 1995. On June 27, 1995,

Tracinda commenced a cash tender offer for up to 14 million shares of Chrysler

common stock at a price of $50 per share. Due to the small percentage of shares

sought by Tracinda, Chrysler's Board of Directors has determined not to take a

position with respect to the tender offer.

<BR>



<H3><A NAME="013">Note 8. Special Plant Provision</A></H3>

<P>

     The results of operations for the second quarter of 1995 include a $232

million provision for costs associated with planned production changes at

Chrysler's Newark assembly plant. The plant will end production of Chrysler's

LeBaron convertibles in July 1995. In addition, Newark production of the

Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid will be reduced to one shift in August 1995

and will end prior to production of a new vehicle in the fall of 1997. The

provision includes the recognition of supplemental unemployment benefits, job

security benefits and other related employee costs, and the write-down of

certain equipment and tooling.

     Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes of $238 million for the

second quarter of 1995, compared with $1,593 million for the second quarter of

1994. For the first six months of 1995, Chrysler reported earnings before income

taxes of $1,208 million, compared with $3,136 million for the first six months

of 1994. Pretax earnings for the second quarter and first six months of 1995

include a $232 million charge for costs associated with planned production

changes at Chrysler's Newark assembly plant. Net earnings for the second quarter

of 1995 were $135 million, or $0.35 per common share, compared with $956

million, or $2.61 per common share for the second quarter of 1994. Net earnings

for the six months ended June 30, 1995 were $727 million or $1.92 per common

share, compared with $1,894 million or $5.16 per common share for the comparable

1994 period. Net earnings for the second quarter and first six months of 1995

were reduced by $143 million as a result of the Newark assembly plant

charge.

<BR>

<P>

     The lower operating results in the second quarter and first six months

of 1995 compared with the corresponding periods of 1994 resulted primarily from

lower minivan production and costs associated with the model changeover and

launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans, the charge related to the Newark assembly

plant, higher incentives and material costs, costs associated with the voluntary

minivan owner service action, a lower mix of higher-margin vehicles, and lower

factory unit sales in Mexico. Lower minivan production and costs associated with

the model changeover and launch of the all-new minivans will continue into the

third quarter of 1995. In addition, Chrysler expects higher incentives and

material costs, a lower mix of higher-margin vehicles, and lower factory unit

sales in Mexico in the third quarter of 1995 as compared with the third quarter

of 1994. Pretax earnings for the first quarter and first six months of 1995

include a charge of $115 million for the voluntary minivan owner service

action.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's worldwide factory car and truck sales for the three and six

months ended June 30, 1995 were 635,151 and 1,349,916 units, respectively, a

decrease of 67,651 and 93,484 units from the second quarter and first six months

of 1994, respectively. Minivan factory units sales for the second quarter and

first six months of 1995 were 117,963 and 262,910 units, respectively, a

decrease of 59,637 and 92,417 units from the comparable 1994 periods. The

decline in minivan factory units sales was primarily attributable to the model

changeover and launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans. Combined U.S. and Canadian

dealers' days supply of vehicle inventory was 45 days at June 30, 1995, as

compared with 69 days at December 31, 1994 and 45 days at June 30, 1994.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's revenues and results of operations are principally derived

from the U.S. and Canada automotive marketplace. In the second quarter of 1995,

U.S. and Canada vehicle industry retail sales, on a Seasonally Adjusted Annual

Rate basis, were 15.8 million cars and trucks, compared to 16.4 million units

for the second quarter of 1994, a decrease of 4 percent. This decrease is

primarily due to a slowdown in economic growth and higher interest rates, which

resulted in Chrysler increasing retail incentives in the first half of 1995 and

lowering total year 1995 planned production.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's U.S. and Canada combined retail car and truck market share

for the three and six months ended June 30, 1995 decreased compared with the

corresponding 1994 periods. Increases in car market share

were offset by decreases in truck market share in the second quarter and first

six months of 1995, as shown in the following table:

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's U.S. car market share increased in the second quarter and

first six months of 1995 primarily as a result of increased sales of Chrysler's

mid-size sedans and coupes. The decrease in Chrysler's U.S. truck market share

for the three and six months ended June 30, 1995 was primarily the result of

decreases in retail minivan sales of 17,147 and 51,274, respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler vehicles manufactured and sold in Mexico during the second

quarter and first six months of 1995 were 4,300 and 10,100 units, respectively,

a decrease of 13,900 and 32,500 units from the corresponding 1994 periods,

respectively. The impact of the lower sales in Mexico during the second quarter

and first six months of 1995 was partially offset by increased sales of, and

higher profits on, vehicles manufactured in Mexico and exported to other

markets. The devaluation of the peso and the continuing economic uncertainties

in Mexico will continue to negatively impact Chrysler's operating results and

financial position for the remainder of 1995.

<BR>

<P>

     Pretax earnings of Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") for the

second quarter of 1995 and 1994 were $127 million and $69 million, respectively.

For the six months ended June 30, 1995, CFC's pretax earnings were $236 million

compared with $144 million for the first six months of 1994. The improved

results in the second quarter and first six months of 1995 compared with the

corresponding 1994 periods were primarily the result of higher levels of

automotive financing and lower bank costs. CFC's net earnings for the second

quarter of 1995 and 1994 were $86 million and $44 million, respectively. CFC's

net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 1995 and 1994 were $155 million

and $91 million, respectively.

<P>

     The decrease in sales of manufactured products in the second quarter of

1995 as compared with the second quarter of 1994 primarily reflects a 10 percent

decrease in factory unit sales partially offset by an increase in average

revenue per unit, net of sales incentives, from $17,676 to $18,198. The decrease

in sales of manufactured products in the first six months of 1995 as compared

with the first six months of 1994 primarily reflects a 6 percent decrease in

factory unit sales partially offset by an increase in average revenue per unit,

net of sales incentives, from $17,236 to $17,964.

<BR>

<P>

     The increase in finance and insurance income for the three and six

months ended June 30, 1995 as compared with the corresponding 1994 periods was

primarily attributable to higher levels of automotive financing volume. Total

automotive financing volume in the second quarter and first six months of 1995

was $21.4 billion and $41.9 billion, respectively, compared with $17.9 billion

and $35.0 billion for the corresponding 1994 periods.

<BR>

<P>

     The increase in other income for the three and six months ended June

30, 1995 as compared with the corresponding periods in 1994 was principally due

to increased interest income resulting from higher cash, cash equivalents and

marketable securities balances and higher interest rates.

six months of 1995, as compared with the corresponding 1994 periods, primarily

as a result of increased product costs and costs associated with the changeover

and launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans, partially offset by the effect of a

decrease in factory unit sales of 10 percent and 6 percent, respectively. The

increase in product costs for the second quarter and first six months of 1995

resulted primarily from higher material and warranty costs and increased product

content. In addition, Costs, other than items below for the six months ended

June 30, 1995 includes a charge of $115 million related to the voluntary minivan

owner service action. Costs, other than items below were 84

percent and 83 percent of sales of manufactured products for the respective

three and six month periods ended June 30, 1995, compared with 76 percent for

both the three and six month periods ended June 30, 1994.

<BR>

<P>

     Depreciation of property and equipment for the second quarter and first

six months of 1995 increased as compared with the corresponding 1994 periods

primarily as a result of higher investments in, and modernization of, property

and equipment.

<BR>

<P>

     Special tooling amortization increased in the second quarter and first

six months of 1995 as compared with the corresponding 1994 periods primarily as

a result of production of Chrysler's all-new minivan and mid-size sedan

products.

<BR>

<P>

     The increase in selling and administrative expenses for the second

quarter and first six months of 1995, as compared with the corresponding 1994

periods, was principally due to increased advertising related to Chrysler's

all-new sedans and mid-size coupes.

<BR>

<P>

     Pension expense decreased for the three and six months ended June 30,

1995 as compared to the corresponding 1994 periods, due to improved funding of

the pension plans and an increase in the discount rate used to determine pension

expense.

<BR>

<P>

     The increase in interest expense for the three and six months ended

June 30, 1995 was primarily due to higher average CFC borrowings, partially

offset by the effect of automotive debt repayments. CFC's average effective cost

of borrowings was 8.3 percent and 8.1 percent in the second quarter and first

six months of 1995, respectively, compared with 8.4 percent in both the

corresponding periods of 1994. This improvement in the average effective

borrowing costs reflects lower bank facility costs.

     Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

totaled $7.8 billion at June 30, 1995 (including $988 million held by CFC),

compared with $8.4 billion at December 31, 1994. The decrease in the first six

months of 1995 was the result of capital expenditures, profit-based employee

payments, debt repayments, common stock repurchases and dividend payments,

largely offset by cash generated by operating activities.

<BR>

<P>

     In December 1994, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion

common stock repurchase program, subject to market and business conditions.

During the second quarter and the first six months of 1995, Chrysler repurchased

5.5 and 14.1 million shares, respectively, of its common stock under this

program at a cost of $239 and $608 million, respectively. During the second

quarter and the first six months of 1995, holders of the Series A Convertible

Preferred Stock converted 699,575 and 1,469,172 shares, respectively, of

preferred stock into 19.4 and 40.8 million shares of common stock,

respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     In the second quarter of 1995, Chrysler increased its quarterly common

dividend from $0.40 to $0.50 per common share.

<BR>

<P>

     At June 30, 1995, Chrysler (excluding CFC), had debt maturities

totaling $226 million through 1997. During the first six months of 1995,

Chrysler redeemed $300 million of its 13% Debentures Due 1997 and repaid $170

million of other debt. At June 30, 1995, Chrysler had a $1.7 billion revolving

credit agreement which expires in July 1999. At June 30, 1995, none of the

commitment was drawn upon. Chrysler believes that cash from operations and its

cash position will be sufficient to enable it to meet its capital expenditure,

debt maturity, common stock repurchase and other funding requirements.

<BR>

<P>

     Receivable sales continued to be a significant source of funding for

CFC, which realized $3.2 billion of net proceeds from the sale of automotive

retail receivables in the first six months of 1995, compared with $3.5 billion

of net proceeds in the first six months of 1994. In addition, securitization of

wholesale receivables

provided funding for CFC which aggregated $7.3 billion and $4.5 billion at June

30, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     During the second quarter of 1995, CFC replaced its existing U.S. and

Canadian revolving credit and receivable sales agreements with new revolving

credit facilities totaling $8.0 billion. At June 30, 1995, no amounts were

outstanding under CFC's revolving credit facilities.

<BR>

<P>

     At June 30, 1995, CFC had contractual debt maturities of $4.4 billion

during the remainder of 1995 (including $3.4 billion of short-term notes), $1.6

billion in 1996 and $1.7 billion in 1997. CFC believes that cash provided by

operations, receivable sales, access to term debt markets, and issuance of

commercial paper will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its funding

requirements.

<A NAME="new"><H3>NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD</H3>

</STRONG>

<BR>

</CENTER><P>

     In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued

Statement of Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of

Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," effective for

fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. This Statement establishes

accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived assets, certain

identifiable intangibles, and goodwill related to those assets to be held and

used and long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed

of. The Statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable

intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever

events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset

may not be recoverable. In addition, the Statement requires that certain

long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles to be disposed of be reported at

the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Chrysler has not

determined the impact that the adoption of this accounting standard will have on

its consolidated operating results or financial position. Chrysler will adopt

this accounting standard on or before January 1, 1996, as required.

<P>

     In December 1990 and January 1991, eight class action lawsuits were

commenced by separate plaintiffs against Chrysler and certain of its directors

in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for New Castle County,

Delaware. The Complaints in these suits are very similar and allege that the

directors breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders by amending Chrysler's

Share Purchase Rights Plan in a manner designed to entrench themselves in office

and to impair the right of stockholders to avail themselves of offers to

purchase their shares by an acquiror not favored by management. The Complaints

ask for (a) certification of the class, (b) rescission of and an injunction

against implementation of the Rights Plan amendments, (c) an order that Chrysler

cooperate with Kirk Kerkorian, the holder of 9.8% of Chrysler's common stock at

the time the complaints were filed, and take steps to enhance its attractiveness

as a merger/acquisition candidate, and (d) damages and costs. On January 9,

1991, the eight suits were consolidated into one. On January 28, 1991,

Chrysler filed an Answer and Affirmative Defenses in the consolidated case. On

March 7, 1991, the parties agreed to allow an Amended Complaint to be filed

which purports to assert a derivative claim brought on behalf of Chrysler, in

addition to class action claims as originally filed. In this regard, the Amended

Complaint alleges injury to Chrysler as a direct result of violations of

fiduciary duties by the individual defendants. On July 25, 1991, Chrysler filed

a motion to dismiss the consolidated lawsuit. On July 27, 1992, the Court

entered a memorandum opinion dismissing the complaint as to all claims for

relief other than rescission. Chrysler later filed a Motion for Reargument which

was denied on August 11, 1992. On June 6, 1995, Chrysler entered into a

Memorandum of Understanding which contemplates settlement of the litigation. The

Memorandum is subject to several conditions, including satisfactory completion

of discovery as to the fairness of the proposed settlement, and the settlement

itself is subject to Court approval. The Memorandum also contemplates that the

settlement, if approved, will consist of Chrysler's recent action further

amending its Rights Plan.

<BR>

<P>

     In April 1995, thirty four class action lawsuits were commenced by

separate plaintiffs against Chrysler, certain of its current and former

directors and, in some cases, Tracinda, a holding company wholly owned by Mr.

Kerkorian and the beneficial owner of approximately 9.41% of the outstanding

common stock of Chrysler as of June 30, 1995, and its affiliates, in the Court

of Chancery of the State of Delaware for New Castle County, Delaware. The

Complaints in these suits fall into two general categories: (a) those which

allege that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders by

failing to negotiate with Tracinda, regarding its proposal to acquire all of the

outstanding stock of Chrysler not then owned by it; and (b) those which allege

that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders by

contemplating, planning and/or effecting Tracinda's proposal at a time when the

market price of Chrysler's stock was depressed and did not reflect its true

value. The Complaints in the former category ask for, among other things, (a) an

injunction or an order obligating the Board of Directors to undertake an

evaluation of alternatives, including measures with respect to the Company's

Rights Plan, designed to maximize shareholder value, (b) a declaration that the

defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs, (c)

compensatory damages and interest, and (d) costs and fees. The Complaints in the

latter category ask for, among other things, (a) a declaration that the

transaction proposed by Tracinda is unfair, unjust and inequitable, (b) an

injunction against implementation of the transaction proposed by Tracinda and

any improper device which impedes maximization of shareholder value, (c) damages

and interest, (d) costs and fees, and (e) such other relief as may be just and

proper. Four of these actions have subsequently been dismissed without prejudice

by the plaintiffs.

     This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental

Operations on an Equity Basis)," reflects the results of operations of Chrysler

with its investments in Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") and its

investments in short-term vehicle rental subsidiaries (the "Car Rental

Operations") accounted for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated

subsidiaries. This Supplemental Information does not purport to present results

of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

because it does not comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

("SFAS") No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." Due to the

fact that the operations of CFC and the Car Rental Operations are different in

nature than Chrysler's manufacturing operations, management believes that this

disaggregated financial data enhances an understanding of the consolidated

financial statements.

NOTE: Primary earnings per common share amounts were computed by dividing

          earnings after deduction of preferred stock dividends by the average

          number of common and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding.

          Computations of primary earnings per common share exclude the effect

          of common stock equivalents and shares contingently issuable for any

          period in which their inclusion would have the effect of increasing

          the earnings per common share amount or decreasing the loss per common

          share amount otherwise computed.

<BR>

<P>

          Fully diluted per common share amounts assume conversion of the

          convertible preferred stock, the elimination of the related preferred

          stock dividend requirement, and the issuance of common stock for all

          other potentially dilutive equivalents outstanding unless such

          conversion has the effect of increasing the earnings per common share

          amount or decreasing the loss per common share amount otherwise

          computed.

<P>

     We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of

Chrysler Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of June 30, 1995 and 1994,

and the related consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for the

three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 1995 and 1994. These financial

statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

<BR>

<P>

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the

American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim

financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to

financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and

accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in

accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is

the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a

whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

<BR>

<P>

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications

that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above

for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

<BR>

<P>

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted

auditing standards, the consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Corporation and

consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994, and the related consolidated

statements of earnings and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented

herein); and in our report dated January 16, 1995, we expressed an unqualified

opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the

information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet

as of December 31, 1994, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation

to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

<h2><a name="note1">Note 1. Consolidation and Financial Statement Presentation</a></h2>

     The consolidated financial statements of Chrysler Corporation and its

consolidated subsidiaries ("Chrysler") include the accounts of all significant

majority-owned subsidiaries and entities. Intercompany accounts and transactions

have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited consolidated financial

statements of Chrysler for the three months ended March 31, 1995 and 1994

reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring items, which

are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the

results for the interim periods. The operating results for the three months

ended March 31, 1995 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations

for the entire year. Reference should be made to the consolidated financial

statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 1994. Amounts for 1994 have been reclassified to conform with

current period classifications.

<h2><a name="note3">Note 3. Changes in Accounting Principles</a></h2>

     Effective January 1, 1995, Chrysler adopted Statement of Financial

Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment

of a Loan" and SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan

-- Income Recognition and Disclosures." These new accounting standards require

creditors to evaluate the collectibility of both contractual interest and

principal of receivables when evaluating the need for a loss accrual. The

implementation of these new accounting standards did not have a material impact

on Chrysler's consolidated operating results or financial position.

<p>



<h2><a name="note4">Note 4. Sales of Automotive Assets and Investments</a></h2>

     During the first quarter of 1994, Chrysler sold its wiring harness

operations and entered into a long-term supply agreement with the purchaser.

Aggregate net proceeds from the sale and the supply agreement were $222 million.

The related pretax gain of $196 million was deferred and is being recognized

over the five-year term of the supply agreement.

<p>



<h2><a name="note5">Note 5. Preferred Stock Conversion</a></h2>

     During the first quarter of 1995, holders of the Series A Convertible

Preferred Stock converted 769,597 shares of Preferred Stock into 21.4 million

shares of common stock.

<p>





<h2><a name="note6">Note 6. Common Stock Repurchase</a></h2>

     In December 1994, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion

common stock repurchase program, subject to market and business conditions.

During the first quarter of 1995, Chrysler repurchased 8.6 million shares of its

common stock under this program at a cost of $369 million (including $31 million

in unsettled repurchases).

<p>



<h2><a name="note7">Note 7. Subsequent Event</a></h2>

     On April 12, 1995, Tracinda Corporation ("Tracinda"), which owns

approximately 10 percent of the outstanding common stock of Chrysler, sent the

Company a letter proposing to acquire the remaining 90 percent of Chrysler's

common stock at $55 per share. Chrysler's Board of Directors stated that the

Company is not for sale and that the letter received from Tracinda would be

reviewed by the Company's Board of Directors and with the Company's financial

and legal advisors.

     Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes of $970 million for the

first quarter of 1995, compared with $1,543 million for the first quarter of

1994. Net earnings for the first quarter of 1995 were $592 million, or $1.59 per

common share, compared with $938 million, or $2.55 per common share, in the

first quarter of 1994.

<P>

     The lower operating results in the first quarter of 1995 compared to the

first quarter of 1994 resulted primarily from lost production and costs

associated with the model changeover and launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans,

costs associated with the voluntary minivan owner service action, higher

material costs, a lower mix of higher-margin vehicles, and lower factory unit

sales in Mexico. Production losses and costs associated with the model

changeover and launch of the all-new minivans will continue through the second

quarter of 1995.

<P>

     Chrysler's worldwide factory car and truck sales for the three months ended

March 31, 1995 were 714,765 units, a 3 percent decrease from the first quarter

of 1994. Combined U.S. and Canadian dealers' days supply of vehicle inventory

was 66 days at March 31, 1995, as compared to 50 days at March 31, 1994.

<P>

     Chrysler's revenues and results of operations are principally derived from

the U.S. and Canada automotive marketplace. In the first quarter of 1995, U.S.

and Canada vehicle industry retail sales, on a Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate

basis, were 16.5 million cars and trucks, compared to 17.2 million units for the

first quarter of 1994, a decrease of 4 percent. This decrease is primarily due

to a slowdown in economic growth and higher interest rates, which resulted in

Chrysler increasing retail incentives in the first quarter of 1995 and lowering

1995 planned production. The higher incentives will likely continue throughout

the 1995 model year.

<P>

     Chrysler's U.S. and Canada combined retail car and truck market share for

the first quarter of 1995 was lower than the first quarter of 1994. Increases in

car market share were offset by decreases in truck market share in the first

quarter of 1995, as shown in the following table:

(1) All retail sale and market share data include fleet sales.

<P>

     Chrysler's U.S. car market share increased in the first quarter of 1995 as

compared to the first quarter of 1994 as a result of increased sales of

Chrysler's midsize sedans and coupes. The decrease in Chrysler's U.S. truck

market share for the first quarter of 1995 as compared to first quarter of 1994

reflects a decline in minivan and Jeep(R) sales, partially offset by an increase

in pickup truck sales. Chrysler's all-new 1996 minivans will be introduced in

the second quarter of 1995.

<P>

     Pretax earnings of Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") for the first

quarter of 1995 and 1994 were $109 million and $75 million, respectively. The

improved results in the first quarter of 1995 compared to the first quarter of

1994 were primarily the result of higher levels of automotive financing and

lower bank costs partially offset by continuing interest rate pressure on

automotive consumer lending margins. CFC reported net earnings of $69 million

and $47 million for the first quarter of 1995 and 1994, respectively.

<P>

     Sales of Chrysler vehicles manufactured in Mexico and exported to the U.S.

and Canada in the first quarter of 1995 increased 5 percent from the first

quarter of 1994, to 35,400 vehicles. Due to the impact of the

devaluation of the peso, vehicles manufactured in Mexico and sold in Mexico

decreased to 5,800 units in the first quarter of 1995 from 24,400 units in the

first quarter of 1994. The impact of the lower sales in Mexico was partially

offset by increased profits on sales of vehicles manufactured in Mexico and

exported to the U.S. and Canada. Sales in Mexico of vehicles manufactured in the

U.S. and Canada were not significant in the first quarter of 1995 and 1994.

Chrysler cannot predict the extent that the devaluation of the peso and the

resulting uncertainty surrounding the Mexican economic and political

environments will have on its operating results in 1995.

<P>

     The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") conducted an

engineering analysis of the rear liftgate latches on all Chrysler 1984-1994

model year minivans. Although NHTSA has not concluded that the rear liftgate

latches are defective, to alleviate customer concerns, Chrysler announced in the

first quarter of 1995, a voluntary owner service action to replace the rear

liftgate latches on all of its 1984-1994 minivans. Chrysler believes that this

service action will conclude this matter. The estimated pretax cost of the

voluntary owner service action of $115 million is included in first quarter

results.

<P>

     Chrysler has benefitted from several economic factors over the past few

years, including: (1) continuing economic recoveries and relatively strong

automobile sales in the U.S. and Canada, where Chrysler's sales are

concentrated, (2) a cost advantage in comparison to vehicles manufactured in

Japan (or vehicles containing significant material components manufactured in

Japan) as a result of favorable exchange rates between the Japanese yen and the

U.S. dollar, and (3) a shift in U.S. and Canada consumer preferences toward

trucks, as Chrysler manufactures a higher proportion of trucks to total vehicles

than its principal competitors in the U.S. and Canada. A significant

deterioration of any of these factors could adversely affect Chrysler's

operating results.

</PRE>

     The increase in sales of manufactured products in the first quarter of 1995

primarily reflects an increase in average revenue per unit, net of sales

incentives, from $16,823 in the first quarter of 1994 to $17,758 in the first

quarter of 1995, partially offset by a 3 percent decrease in factory unit sales

in the first quarter of 1995.

<P>

     The increase in finance and insurance income in the first quarter of 1995,

as compared to the first quarter of 1994, was primarily attributable to higher

levels of automotive financing volume. Total automotive financing volume in the

first quarter of 1995 and 1994 was $20.5 billion and $17.1 billion,

respectively.

     Costs, other than items below increased in the first quarter of 1995, as

compared with the first quarter of 1994, primarily as a result of increased

product costs, costs associated with the changeover and launch of Chrysler's

all-new minivans and the voluntary minivan owner service action, partially

offset by the effect of a 3 percent decrease in factory unit sales. The increase

in product costs resulted from higher material costs and increased product

content. Costs, other than items below were 82 percent and 77 percent of sales

of manufactured products for the three months ended March 31, 1995 and 1994,

respectively.

<P>

     Depreciation of property and equipment for the first quarter of 1995

decreased as compared to the first quarter of 1994. Decreases resulting from the

second quarter 1994 revisions to the estimated service lives of certain classes

of property and equipment were partially offset by increases resulting from

Chrysler's facility modernization program.

<P>

     Special tooling amortization increased in the first quarter of 1995, as

compared with the first quarter of 1994, primarily as a result of the shortening

of the remaining service lives of certain special tools in the second quarter of

1994.

<P>

     The increase in selling and administrative expenses for the first quarter

of 1995, as compared to the first quarter of 1994, was principally due to

increased advertising related to the introductions of the all-new sedans,

Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge Stratus and midsize coupes, Chrysler Sebring/Dodge

Avenger.

<P>

     Pension expense for the first quarter of 1995 decreased as compared to the

first quarter of 1994 due to improved funding of the pension plans and an

increase in the discount rate used to determine pension expense.

<P>

     The increase in interest expense for the first quarter of 1995 was

primarily due to higher average CFC borrowings. CFC's average effective cost of

borrowings was 7.9 percent and 8.4 percent in the first quarter of 1995 and

1994, respectively. This improvement in the average effective borrowing costs

reflects lower bank facility costs and higher levels of commercial paper.

<P>



<CENTER><H3><A NAME="resources">LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</A></H3></CENTER>

     Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

totaled $8.3 billion at March 31, 1995 (including $1.0 billion held by CFC), a

slight decrease from December 31, 1994. The decrease in the first quarter of

1995 was the result of profit-based employee payments, capital expenditures,

debt repayments and common stock repurchases, largely offset by cash generated

by operating activities.

<P>

     In December 1994, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion

common stock repurchase program, subject to market and business conditions.

During the first quarter of 1995, Chrysler repurchased 8.6 million shares of its

common stock under this program at a cost of $369 million (including $31 million

in unsettled repurchases). Additionally, in the first quarter of 1995, holders

of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converted 769,597 shares of

Preferred Stock into 21.4 million shares of common stock.

<P>

     At March 31, 1995, Chrysler (excluding CFC), had debt maturities totaling

$95 million through 1997. During the first quarter of 1995, Chrysler redeemed

$300 million of its 13% Debentures Due 1997 and repaid $163 million of other

debt. At March 31, 1995, Chrysler had a $1.7 billion revolving credit agreement

which expires in July 1999. None of the commitment was drawn upon during the

first quarter of 1995. Chrysler believes that cash from operations and its cash

position will be sufficient to enable it to meet its capital expenditure, debt

maturity, common stock repurchase and other funding requirements.

<P>

     Chrysler's ability to market its products successfully depends

significantly on the availability of vehicle financing for its dealers and, to a

lesser extent, the availability of financing for retail and fleet customers,

both of which CFC provides.

<P>

     Receivable sales continued to be a significant source of funding in the

first quarter of 1995 as CFC realized $1.1 billion of net proceeds from the sale

of automotive retail receivables, compared to $1.7 billion of net proceeds in

the first quarter of 1994. In addition, CFC's revolving wholesale receivable

sale arrangements provided funding which aggregated $5.8 billion and $4.6

billion at March 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

<P>

     At March 31, 1995, CFC had U.S. and Canadian credit facilities totaling

$5.2 billion and receivable sale agreements totaling $1.7 billion. At March 31,

1995, no amounts were outstanding under CFC's U.S. and Canadian revolving credit

or receivable sale agreements. During the first quarter of 1995, CFC began the

process of negotiating the early replacement of its U.S. and Canadian revolving

credit facilities and receivable sale agreements.

     At March 31, 1995, CFC had contractual debt maturities of $4.9 billion

during the remainder of 1995 (including $4.1 billion of short-term notes) and

$1.6 billion in 1996. CFC believes that cash provided by operations, receivable

sales, access to term debt markets, and issuance of commercial paper will

provide sufficient liquidity to meet its funding requirements.

     On April 12, 1995, Tracinda Corporation ("Tracinda"), which owns

approximately 10 percent of the outstanding common stock of Chrysler, sent the

Company a letter proposing to acquire the remaining 90 percent of Chrysler's

common stock at $55 per share. Chrysler's Board of Directors stated that the

Company is not for sale and that the letter received from Tracinda would be

reviewed by the Company's Board of Directors and with the Company's financial

and legal advisors.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="accountantreview">REVIEW BY INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS</A></H3></CENTER>

     Deloitte & Touche LLP, Chrysler's independent public accountants, performed

a review of the financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 1995

and 1994 in accordance with the standards for such reviews established by the

American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The review did not

constitute an audit, and accordingly, Deloitte & Touche LLP did not express an

opinion on the aforementioned data. Refer to the Independent Accountants' Report

included at Exhibit 15A.

<H2>Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</A></H2>

     The State of Wisconsin filed a lawsuit against Chrysler Outboard

Corporation, a Chrysler subsidiary now known as Beaver Dam Products Corporation,

in February 1995 alleging improper disposal of hazardous waste in 1969. This

     This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental

Operations on an Equity Basis)," reflects the results of operations of Chrysler

with its investments in Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") and its

investments in short-term vehicle rental subsidiaries (the "Car Rental

Operations") accounted for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated

subsidiaries. This Supplemental Information does not purport to present results

of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

because it does not comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

("SFAS") No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." The

financial covenant contained in Chrysler's revolving credit facility is based on

this Supplemental Information. In addition, because the operations of CFC and

the Car Rental Operations are different in nature than Chrysler's manufacturing

operations, management believes that this disaggregated financial data enhances

an understanding of the consolidated financial statements.

     This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental

Operations on an Equity Basis)," reflects the cash flows of Chrysler with its

investments in CFC and the Car Rental Operations accounted for on an equity

basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries. This Supplemental Information

does not purport to present cash flows in accordance with generally accepted

accounting principles because it does not comply with SFAS No. 94,

"Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." The financial covenant

contained in Chrysler's revolving credit facility is based on this Supplemental

Information. In addition, because the operations of CFC and the Car Rental

Operations are different in nature than Chrysler's manufacturing operations,

management believes that this disaggregated financial data enhances an

understanding of the consolidated financial statements.

NOTE: Earnings per common share amounts were computed by dividing earnings after

      deduction of preferred stock dividends by the average number of common and

      dilutive equivalent shares outstanding. In the first quarter of 1995,

      fully diluted per common share amounts assume conversion of the

      convertible preferred stock, the elimination of the related preferred

      stock dividend requirement, and the issuance of common stock for all other

      potentially dilutive equivalents outstanding. Computations of primary

      earnings per common share exclude the effect of common stock equivalents

      and shares contingently issuable for any year in which their inclusion

      would have the effect of increasing the earnings per common share amount

      or decreasing the loss per common share amount otherwise computed.

     We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler

Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 1995 and 1994 and the

related consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for the three-month

periods ended March 31, 1995 and 1994. These financial statements are the

responsibility of the Company's management.

<P>

     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the

American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim

financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to

financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and

accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in

accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is

the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a

whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

<P>

     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that

should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for

them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

<P>

     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing

standards, the consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Corporation and

consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994, and the related consolidated

statements of earnings and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented

herein); and in our report dated January 16, 1995, we expressed an unqualified

opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the

information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet

as of December 31, 1994, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation

to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

<h3>Note 1. Consolidation and Financial Statement Presentation</h3>



     The consolidated financial statements of Chrysler Corporation and its

consolidated subsidiaries ("Chrysler") include the accounts of all significant

majority-owned subsidiaries and entities. Intercompany accounts and

transactions

have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited consolidated financial

statements of Chrysler for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1995

and 1994 reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring

items,

which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement

of the results for the interim periods. The operating results for the three and

nine months ended September 30, 1995 are not necessarily indicative of the

results of operations for the entire year. Reference should be made to the

consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form

10-K for

the year ended December 31, 1994. Amounts for 1994 have been reclassified to

conform with current period classifications.

<H3><A NAME="007">Note 3. Sales of Automotive Assets and Investments</A></H3>

<P>

     Chrysler sold its wiring harness operations and certain of its soft

trim operations in the first and second quarters of 1994, respectively, and

entered into long-term supply agreements with each of the purchasers. Aggregate

net proceeds from the sales and the supply agreements were $315 million. The

related pretax gains of $254 million were deferred and are being recognized

over

the periods of the respective supply agreements.

<BR>

<H3><A NAME="008">Note 4. Preferred Stock Conversion and Supplementary

Earnings Per Share Data</A></H3>

<P>

     During the third quarter and the first nine months of 1995, holders of

the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converted 88,416 and 1,557,588 shares,

respectively, of preferred stock into 2.5 and 43.3 million shares of common

stock, respectively. Primary earnings per common share for the third

quarter and

the first nine months of 1995 were calculated based upon a weighted average of

common shares outstanding which included the additional shares from the

preferred stock conversions. If all of the preferred stock conversions had

occurred on January 1, 1995, primary earnings per common share for the first

nine months of 1995 would have been $2.73.

<BR>

<H3><A NAME="009">Note 5. Common Stock Repurchase Program</A></H3>

<P>

     During the third quarter of 1995, Chrysler's Board of Directors

approved an increase in Chrysler's common stock repurchase program from $1

billion to $2 billion to be completed by the end of 1996, depending on market

conditions. During the third quarter and the first nine months of 1995,

Chrysler

repurchased 3.3 and 17.4 million shares, respectively, of its common stock

under

this program at a cost of $174 and $782 million (including $13 million in

unsettled purchases), respectively.

<BR>

<H3><A NAME="010">Note 6. Special Plant Provision</A></H3>

<P>

     During the second quarter of 1995, Chrysler recorded a $232 million

provision for costs associated with production changes at Chrysler's Newark

assembly plant. The plant ended production of Chrysler's LeBaron

convertibles in

July 1995. In addition, Newark production of the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge

Intrepid was reduced to one shift in August 1995 and will end prior to

production of a new vehicle in the fall of 1997. The provision includes the

recognition of supplemental unemployment benefits, job security benefits and

other related employee costs, and the write-down of certain equipment and

tooling. During the third quarter, this provision was increased by $31 million

to $263 million, primarily reflecting changes in the estimate for job security

benefit costs.

     Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes of $582 million for the




third quarter of 1995, compared with $1,063 million for the third quarter of




1994. For the first nine months of 1995, Chrysler reported earnings before




income taxes of $1,790 million, compared with $4,199 million for the first nine




months of 1994. Net earnings for the third quarter of 1995 were $354




million, or




$0.91 per common share, compared with $651 million, or $1.76 per common share




for the third quarter of 1994. Net earnings for the nine months ended September




30, 1995 were $1,081 million or $2.82 per common share, compared with $2,545




million or $6.92 per common share for the comparable 1994 period.




<BR>




<P>




     The lower operating results in the third quarter of 1995 compared with




the corresponding period in 1994 resulted primarily from lower minivan




production volume, costs associated with the launch of Chrysler's all-new




minivans and the launch of Chrysler's full-size Dodge Ram pickup truck at an




additional facility, a lower mix of higher-margin vehicles, higher incentives




and lower factory unit sales in Mexico.




<BR>




<P>




     The lower operating results in the first nine months of 1995 compared




with the corresponding period in 1994 resulted primarily from lower minivan




production volume and costs associated with the model changeover and launch of




Chrysler's all-new minivans, higher incentives and material costs, a provision




for costs associated with production changes at Chrysler's Newark assembly




plant, a lower mix of higher-margin vehicles, and lower factory unit sales in




Mexico.




<BR>




<P>




     Chrysler's worldwide factory car and truck sales for the three and nine




months ended September 30, 1995 were 581,853 and 1,931,769 units, respectively,




a decrease of 11,904 and 105,388 units from the third quarter and first nine




months of 1994, respectively. Minivan factory sales for the third quarter and




first nine months of 1995 were 125,299 and 388,209 units, respectively, a




decrease of 29,011 and 121,428 units from the comparable 1994 periods. The




decline in minivan factory unit sales was primarily attributable to the model




changeover and launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans. Worldwide minivan factory




unit sales in the fourth quarter of 1995 are expected to be comparable to




fourth




quarter 1994 minivan factory unit sales.




<BR>




<P>




     Chrysler's revenues and results of operations are derived principally




from the U.S. and Canada automotive marketplace. In the third quarter of 1995,




retail sales of new cars and trucks in the U.S. and Canada, on a Seasonally




Adjusted Annual Rate basis, were 16.2 million units, the same as for the third




quarter of 1994. Combined U.S. and Canadian dealers' days supply of vehicle




inventory was 62 days at September 30, 1995, as compared with 54 days at




September 30, 1994.




<BR>




<P>




     Chrysler's U.S. and Canada combined retail car and truck market share

combined car and truck market share for the nine months ended September 30,




1995

     Chrysler vehicles manufactured and sold in Mexico during the third




quarter and first nine months of 1995 were 5,000 and 15,100 units,




respectively,




a decrease of 15,700 and 48,100 units from the corresponding 1994 periods. The




impact of the lower sales in Mexico during the third quarter and first nine




months of 1995 was partially offset by higher profits on vehicles manufactured




in Mexico and exported to other markets. The unfavorable economic conditions in




Mexico are expected to continue to have a negative impact on Chrysler's




operating results and financial position.

     Pretax earnings of Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") for the third




quarter of 1995 and 1994 were $138 million and $82 million, respectively. For




the nine months ended September 30, 1995, CFC's pretax earnings were $374




million compared with $226 million for the first nine months of 1994. CFC's net




earnings for the third quarter of 1995 and 1994 were $87 million and $50




million, respectively. CFC's net earnings for the nine months ended September




30, 1995 and 1994 were $242 million and $141 million, respectively. The




increase




in earnings for the three months ended September 30, 1995 reflects higher




levels




of automotive financing and lower operating expenses. The increase in earnings




for the nine months ended September 30, 1995, reflects higher levels of




automotive financing and lower bank costs and operating expenses.

     The increase in sales of manufactured products in the third quarter of

in average revenue per unit, net of sales incentives, from $18,252 to $19,110




partially offset by a 2 percent decrease in factory unit sales. The decrease in




sales of manufactured products in the first nine months of 1995 as compared




with




the first nine months of 1994 primarily reflects a 5 percent decrease in




factory




unit sales partially offset by an increase in average revenue per unit, net of




sales incentives, from $17,533 to $18,309. The increase in average revenue per




unit in the third quarter and first nine months of 1995 as compared to the




corresponding periods of 1994 was primarily due to pricing actions and a

     The increase in finance and insurance income for the three and nine

1995 was $19.6 billion and $61.5 billion, respectively, compared with $16.3




billion and $51.3 billion for the corresponding 1994 periods.

     The increase in other income for the three and nine months ended




September 30, 1995 as compared with the corresponding periods in 1994 was




principally due to increased interest income resulting from higher average

     Costs, other than items below increased in the third quarter and first




nine months of 1995, as compared with the corresponding 1994 periods, primarily




as a result of increased product costs and costs associated with the changeover




and launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans, partially offset by the effect of a




decrease in factory unit sales of 2 percent and 5 percent, respectively. The




increase in product costs for the third quarter of 1995




resulted primarily from higher material costs, including increased product




content. The increase in product costs for the first nine months of 1995




resulted primarily from higher material costs (including increased product




content) and higher warranty costs. Warranty costs for the first nine months of




1995, include a charge of $115 million related to the voluntary minivan owner




service action. Costs, other than items below were 84 percent and 83 percent of




sales of manufactured products for the respective three and nine month periods




ended September 30, 1995, compared with 79 percent and 77 percent for the three

     Depreciation of property and equipment for the third quarter and first




nine months of 1995 increased as compared with the corresponding 1994 periods




primarily as a result of higher investments in, and modernization of, property

     Special tooling amortization increased in the third quarter and first

primarily as




a result of production of Chrysler's all-new minivans and mid-size sedans.

<P>




     Pension expense decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of




1995 as compared to the corresponding 1994 periods, due to improved funding of




the pension plans and an increase in the discount rate used to determine

expense.

     During the second quarter of 1995, Chrysler recorded a $232 million




provision for costs associated with production changes at Chrysler's Newark




assembly plant. The plant ended production of Chrysler's LeBaron




convertibles in




July 1995. In addition, Newark production of the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge




Intrepid was reduced to one shift in August 1995 and will end prior to




production of a new vehicle in the fall of 1997. The provision includes the




recognition of supplemental unemployment benefits, job security benefits and




other related employee costs, and the write-down of certain equipment and




tooling. During the third quarter, this provision was increased by $31 million




to $263 million primarily reflecting changes in the estimate for job security




benefit costs.

     Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities




totaled $7.6 billion at September 30, 1995 (including $1.2 billion held by




CFC),




compared with $8.4 billion at December 31, 1994. The decrease in the first nine




months of 1995 was the result of capital expenditures, profit-based employee




payments, common stock repurchases and dividend payments, largely offset by




cash




generated by operating activities.




<BR>




<P>




     During the third quarter of 1995, Chrysler's Board of Directors




approved an increase in Chrysler's common stock repurchase program from $1




billion to $2 billion to be completed by the end of 1996, depending on market




conditions. During the third quarter and the first nine months of 1995,




Chrysler




repurchased 3.3 and 17.4 million shares, respectively, of its common stock




under




this program at a cost of $174 and $782 million (including $13 million in




unsettled purchases), respectively. During the third quarter and the first nine




months of 1995, holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converted




88,416 and 1,557,588 shares, respectively, of preferred stock into 2.5 and 43.3




million shares of common stock, respectively.




<BR>




<P>




     In the second quarter of 1995, Chrysler increased its quarterly common




dividend from $0.40 to $0.50 per common share.




<BR>




<P>




     At September 30, 1995, Chrysler (excluding CFC), had debt maturities




totaling $229 million through 1997. During the first nine months of 1995,




Chrysler redeemed $300 million of its 13% Debentures Due 1997 and repaid $180




million of other debt. At September 30, 1995, Chrysler had a $1.7 billion




revolving credit agreement which expires in July 1999. At September 30, 1995,




none of the commitment was drawn upon. Chrysler believes that cash from




operations and its cash position will be sufficient to enable it to meet its




capital expenditure, debt maturity, common stock repurchase, dividend payment




and other funding requirements.




<BR>




<P>




     Receivable sales continued to be a significant source of funding for




CFC, which realized $4.7 billion of net proceeds from the sale of automotive




retail receivables in the first nine months of 1995, compared with $5.2 billion




of net proceeds in the first nine months of 1994. In addition,




securitization of




wholesale receivables provided funding for CFC aggregating $6.6 billion and




$3.6




billion at September 30, 1995 and 1994, respectively.




<BR>




<P>




     CFC's U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facilities total $8.0 billion.




At September 30, 1995, no amounts were outstanding under CFC's revolving credit




facilities.




<BR>




<P>




     At September 30, 1995, CFC had contractual debt maturities of $3.1




billion for the remainder of 1995 (including $2.7 billion of short-term notes),




$1.6 billion in 1996 and $2.3 billion in 1997. CFC believes that cash provided




by operations, receivable sales, access to term debt markets, and issuance of




commercial paper will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its funding




requirements.

     In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued




Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the




Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,"




effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. This Statement




establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived assets,




certain identifiable intangibles, and goodwill related to those assets to be




held and used and long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be




disposed of. The Statement requires that long-lived assets and certain




identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for




impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the




carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, the Statement




requires that certain long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles to be




disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost




to sell. Chrysler has not determined the impact that the adoption of this




accounting standard will have on its consolidated operating results or




financial




position. Chrysler will adopt this accounting standard on or before January 1,




1996, as required.

     Five purported class action lawsuits seeking unspecified economic



damages in connection with rear liftgate latches on Chrysler's 1984-1994 model



year minivans have been consolidated in Federal District Court in San



Francisco.



Chrysler previously announced a voluntary owner service action to replace those



latches. The parties have agreed to a proposed settlement that would require



Chrysler to achieve a 60% response rate to its service action by December



31, 1996,



 or spend $14 million on consumer notices and incentives aimed at



increasing the



 response rate. Chrysler would also be required to pay $5.2 million in



attorneys fees and 



costs. Notices were sent to class members in September 1995 following the



Court's preliminary



approval of the settlement. The parties will seek final approval of the



settlement at a hearing 



scheduled for November 3, 1995.

     This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental

Operations on an Equity Basis)," reflects the results of operations of Chrysler

with its investments in Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") and its

investments in short-term vehicle rental subsidiaries (the "Car Rental



Operations") accounted for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated

subsidiaries. This Supplemental Information does not purport to present results



of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles



because it does not comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards



("SFAS") No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." Due to the



fact that the operations of CFC and the Car Rental Operations are different in



nature than Chrysler's manufacturing operations, management believes that this



disaggregated financial data enhances an understanding of the consolidated



financial statements.

<P>


NOTE: Primary earnings per common share amounts were computed by dividing


          earnings after deduction of preferred stock dividends by the average


          number of common and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding.


          Computations of primary earnings per common share exclude the effect


          of common stock equivalents and shares contingently issuable for any


          period in which their inclusion would have the effect of increasing


          the earnings per common share amount or decreasing the loss per


common


          share amount otherwise computed.


<BR>


<P>


          Fully diluted per common share amounts assume conversion of the


          convertible preferred stock, the elimination of the related preferred


          stock dividend requirement, and the issuance of common stock


          for all other potentially dilutive equivalents outstanding unless


such


          conversion has the effect of increasing the earnings per common share


          amount or decreasing the loss per common share amount otherwise


          computed.

     We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of


Chrysler Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of September 30, 1995 and


1994, and the related consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows


for the


three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1995 and 1994. These


financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.


<BR>


<P>


     We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the


American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim


financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to


financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and


accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit


conducted in


accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of


which is


the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a


whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.


<BR>


<P>


     Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications


that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above


for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.


<BR>


<P>


     We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted


auditing standards, the consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Corporation and


consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994, and the related consolidated


statements of earnings and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented


herein); and in our report dated January 16, 1995, we expressed an unqualified


opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the


information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet


as of December 31, 1994, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in


relation


to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

     Chrysler Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Chrysler")

reported earnings before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in

accounting principle of $3.4 billion in 1995, compared with $5.8 billion in

1994. Net earnings for 1995 were $2.0 billion, or $5.11 per fully diluted common

share, compared with $3.7 billion, or $9.10 per fully diluted common share in

1994. Earnings in 1994 represented an all-time record for Chrysler. Earnings in

1995 were the third best in Chrysler's history. Earnings in 1995 were reduced by

a $263 million charge ($162 million after income taxes) for costs associated

with production changes at Chrysler's Newark, Del., assembly plant and a $115

million charge ($71 million after income taxes) for a voluntary minivan owner

service action. Net earnings in 1995 also include a charge of $96 million, or

$0.24 per fully diluted common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in

accounting principle related to the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task

Force Issue 95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed Minimum Resale

Value." Net earnings for 1994 included favorable tax adjustments aggregating

$132 million.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler also reported earnings before income taxes of $1,659 million

in the fourth quarter of 1995, compared with $1,631 million in the fourth

quarter of 1994. Earnings before income taxes for the fourth quarter of 1995

represented an all-time record for Chrysler and earnings before income taxes for

the fourth quarter of 1994 were the second best in Chrysler's history. Net

earnings for the fourth quarter of 1995 were $1,040 million, or $2.67 per fully

diluted common share, compared with $1,168 million, or $2.86 per fully diluted

common share in the fourth quarter of 1994. Net earnings for the fourth quarter

of 1994 included favorable tax adjustments aggregating $132 million. Net

earnings for the fourth quarter of 1994 represented an all-time record for

Chrysler and net earnings for the fourth quarter of 1995 were the second best

quarter in Chrysler's history. Chrysler's worldwide factory car and truck

shipments in the fourth quarter of 1995 were 741,770 units, an increase of

16,824 units or 2 percent from fourth quarter 1994 levels.

<BR>

<P>

     The lower operating results for full year 1995 compared with 1994

resulted primarily from lower minivan shipments and costs associated with the

launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans, higher sales incentives and material

costs, a lower mix of higher-margin vehicles, lower factory shipments in Mexico

and the costs associated with production changes at the Newark assembly

plant.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's worldwide factory car and truck shipments in 1995 were

2,673,539 units, a decrease of 88,564 units or 3 percent from 1994 levels.

Minivan factory shipments in 1995 were 555,824 units, a decrease of 121,652

units from 1994 levels. The decline in minivan factory shipments was primarily

attributable to the launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans at its assembly plants

in St. Louis, Missouri; Windsor, Ontario; and Graz, Austria. By the end of 1995,

the launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans was substantially complete. Minivan

factory shipments in the fourth quarter of 1995 were 167,615 units as compared

with 167,839 units in the fourth quarter of 1994.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's revenues and results of operations are derived principally

from the U.S. and Canada automotive marketplaces. Retail sales of new cars and

trucks in the U.S. and Canada were 16.3 million units in 1995, compared with

16.7 million units in 1994, a decrease of 2 percent. This decrease was primarily

due to a slowdown in economic growth caused primarily by increases in interest

rates. As a result, Chrysler increased retail sales incentives and lowered

production during 1995.

<BR>

<P>

     The decline in Chrysler's U.S. truck market share during 1995 was

primarily due to a decrease in retail sales of Chrysler's minivans largely

offset by a net increase in retail sales of Chrysler's other truck models. The

decrease in minivan retail sales was primarily due to the launch of Chrysler's

all-new minivans. With the completion of the minivan launch and the launch of

Chrysler's full-size <A HREF="http://www.4adodge.com/ram/ram.html">Dodge Ram</A>

 pickup truck at two additional facilities,

Chrysler believes it is well positioned to meet the growing demand for

trucks.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler manufactured 207,004 vehicles and 238,888 vehicles in Mexico

in 1995 and 1994, respectively. Of these totals, 26,503 vehicles and 77,832

vehicles were sold in Mexico in 1995 and 1994, respectively. Sales of vehicles

exported to Mexico were not significant in 1995 or 1994. The decrease in

vehicles manufactured and sold in Mexico was primarily attributable to

unfavorable economic conditions in Mexico, commencing with the devaluation of

the Mexican peso in December 1994. Chrysler's operating results will continue to

be adversely affected to the extent that the unfavorable economic conditions in

Mexico continue. Although Chrysler expects economic conditions in Mexico to

improve slightly in 1996, Chrysler cannot predict when Mexican automotive

industry sales will return to predevaluation levels.

<BR>

<P>

     In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF")

of the Financial Accounting Standards Board reached a consensus on EITF Issue

95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed Minimum Resale Value." The

consensus on EITF Issue 95-1 (the "consensus") affects Chrysler's accounting

treatment for vehicle sales (principally to non-affiliated rental car companies)

for which Chrysler conditionally guarantees the minimum resale value of the

vehicles. In accordance with the consensus, these vehicle sales are accounted

for as operating leases with the related revenues and costs deferred at the time

of shipment. A portion of the deferred revenues and costs is recognized over the

corresponding guarantee period, with the remainder recognized at the end of the

guarantee period. The average guarantee period for these vehicles is

approximately nine months. Chrysler changed its accounting treatment in

accordance with the consensus effective January 1, 1995, which resulted in the

recognition of an after-tax charge of $96 million for the cumulative effect of

this change in accounting principle. The ongoing effect of this accounting

change was not material to 1995 earnings.

<BR>

<P>

     <A HREF="http://www.chryslerfinancial.com/">Chrysler Financial Corporation</A>

 ("CFC") reported earnings before income

taxes of $522 million in 1995, compared with $315 million in 1994. CFC's net

earnings were $339 million in 1995, compared with $195

million in 1994. The increase in earnings in 1995 was primarily attributable to

higher levels of automotive financing, lower operating expenses and lower costs

of bank facilities.

<BR>

<P>

     For the past three years, Chrysler has benefitted from several factors,

including: (1) favorable economic conditions in the U.S. and Canada, where

Chrysler's sales are concentrated, (2) a cost advantage in comparison to

vehicles manufactured in Japan (or vehicles containing significant material

components manufactured in Japan) as a result of favorable exchange rates

between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar, and (3) a continuing shift in U.S.

and Canada consumer preferences toward trucks, as Chrysler manufactures

a higher proportion of trucks to total vehicles than its principal competitors

in the U.S. and Canada. A significant deterioration of any of these factors

could adversely affect Chrysler's operating results. In addition, Chrysler has

benefitted from a strategy of focusing resources on its core automotive business

and an aggressive capital expenditure and vehicle development program that has

resulted in the replacement of substantially all of its car and truck offerings

over the last four years. Chrysler's long-term profitability will depend

significantly on its ability to continue its capital expenditure and vehicle

development programs and market its vehicles successfully.

<P>

     Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes and the cumulative

effect of changes in accounting principles of $5.8 billion in 1994, compared

with $3.8 billion in 1993. The earnings in 1993 included gains on sales of

automotive assets and investments totaling $265 million.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler reported net earnings for 1994 of $3.7 billion, compared to a

net loss for 1993 of $2.6 billion. Net earnings for 1994 included favorable tax

adjustments aggregating $132 million. The net loss for 1993 resulted from a

charge of $4.7 billion for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting

principle related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

("SFAS") No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than

Pensions." Also included in the 1993 results was a charge of $283 million for

the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relating to the

adoption of SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits"

and a $72 million favorable adjustment of Chrysler's deferred tax assets and

liabilities as a result of the increased U.S. federal income tax rate.

<BR>

<P>

     The improvement in earnings in 1994 over 1993 was primarily the result

of an increase in shipments, a reduction in lower-margin fleet shipments in

proportion to total retail sales and reduced sales incentives, partially offset

by increased profit-based employee compensation costs. Chrysler's worldwide

factory car and truck shipments in 1994 were 2,762,103 units, an increase of

286,365 units or 12 percent from 1993 levels.

     The increase in sales of manufactured products in 1995 as compared with

1994 primarily reflects an increase in average revenue per unit, net of sales

incentives, from $17,663 to $18,305, largely offset by a 3 percent decrease in

factory shipments. The increase in average revenue per unit in 1995 as compared

with 1994 was primarily due to pricing actions, partially offset by higher sales

incentives. The increase in sales of manufactured products in 1994 as compared

with 1993 was primarily due to a 12 percent increase in factory shipments and an

increase in average revenue per unit, net of sales incentives, from $16,461 to

$17,663. The

increase in average revenue per unit in 1994 as compared with 1993 was

principally due to reduced sales incentives and sales of an increased proportion

of trucks to total vehicles.

<BR>

<P>

     The increase in finance and insurance revenues in 1995 as compared with

1994 was primarily attributable to higher levels of automotive financing volume.

The decrease in finance and insurance revenues in 1994 as compared with 1993 was

primarily attributable to reduced nonautomotive financing revenue, resulting

from

sales and liquidations of CFC's nonautomotive receivables, partially offset by

increased levels of automotive financing volume. Total automotive financing

volume in 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $81.9 billion, $70.4 billion and $59.8

billion, respectively. The increases in automotive financing volume over the

last two years reflects higher retail lease penetration and higher levels of

dealer financing.

     Other revenues increased in 1995 as compared with 1994 primarily as a

result of increased interest income, reflecting Chrysler's higher average cash,

     "Costs, other than items below" increased in 1995 as compared with 1994

primarily as a result of increased product costs, costs associated with the

changeover and launch of Chrysler's all-new minivans and costs associated with

production changes at the Newark assembly plant, partially offset by the effect

of a decrease in factory shipments of 3 percent. The increase in product costs

in 1995 resulted primarily from higher material costs (including increased

product content) and higher warranty costs. Warranty costs in 1995 included a

charge of $115 million related to a voluntary minivan owner service action and

the effect of

enhanced warranty programs. "Costs, other than items below" increased in 1994 as

compared with 1993 primarily due to a 12 percent increase in factory shipments.

"Costs, other than items below" as a percent of sales of manufactured products

were 83 percent, 77 percent and 79 percent in 1995, 1994 and 1993,

respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     Depreciation of property and equipment in 1995 increased as compared

with 1994 primarily as a result of higher levels of property and equipment in

use. Depreciation of property and equipment in 1994 was comparable to 1993 as

increases resulting from higher levels of property and equipment in use were

largely

offset by reductions at CFC resulting from the sales and downsizing of its

nonautomotive financing operations. Special tooling amortization increased in

1995 as compared with 1994 primarily as a result of increased tooling costs for

Chrysler's new products. Special tooling amortization increased in 1994 as

compared with 1993 primarily as a result of the shortening of the remaining

service lives of certain special tools in 1994.

<BR>

<P>

     Selling and administrative expenses increased in 1995 as compared with

1994 primarily as a result of advertising costs related to Chrysler's all-new

minivans, sedans and coupes. Selling and administrative expenses increased in

1994 as compared with 1993 primarily as a result of increased advertising and

profit-based employee compensation costs.

<BR>

<P>

     Pension expense decreased in 1995 as compared with 1994 due to improved

funding of the pension plans and an increase in the discount rate used to

determine 1995 pension expense. Pension expense decreased in 1994 as compared

with 1993 due to improved funding of the pension plans, partially offset by

increases resulting from a reduction in the discount rate used to determine 1994

pension expense and benefit increases from Chrysler's 1993 national contracts

with its principal bargaining units. Chrysler's contributions to the pension

fund during 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $838 million, $2.6 billion and $3.5

billion, respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     Nonpension postretirement benefit expense decreased in 1995 as compared

with 1994 primarily as a result of an increase in the discount rate used to

determine 1995 nonpension postretirement benefit expense and favorable health

care inflation experience. Nonpension postretirement benefit expense increased

slightly in 1994 as compared with 1993, as increases resulting from a reduction

in the discount rate used to determine nonpension postretirement benefit expense

in 1994 were partially offset by cost savings associated with the implementation

of new managed care initiatives. Nonpension postretirement benefit expense is

expected to increase in 1996 primarily as a result of a reduction in the

discount rate used to determine this expense.

<BR>

<P>

     Interest expense increased slightly in 1995 as compared with 1994

primarily as a result of higher levels of term debt at CFC largely offset by a

decrease in average non-CFC debt levels. The decline in interest expense in 1994

as compared with 1993 was primarily due to reductions in CFC's effective cost of

borrowings, resulting from higher levels of commercial paper, which have lower

costs than borrowings under CFC's bank facilities. CFC's average effective cost

of borrowings was 7.9 percent, 8.0 percent and 8.6 percent in 1995, 1994 and

1993, respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     In 1995, Chrysler recorded a $263 million provision for costs

associated with production changes at its Newark assembly plant. The plant ended

production of Chrysler's LeBaron convertibles in July 1995. In addition, Newark

production of the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid was reduced to one shift

in August 1995 and will end prior to the production of a new vehicle in the fall

of 1997. The provision includes the recognition of supplemental unemployment

benefits, job security benefits and other related employee costs, and the

write-down of certain equipment and tooling. The provision is included in

"Costs, other than items below" in the consolidated statement of earnings.

<BR>

<P>

     Operating results for 1993 included gains on sales of automotive assets

and investments of $265 million. The 1993 pretax gain was comprised of a $205

million gain on the sales of an aggregate of 50.3 million shares of Mitsubishi

Motors Corporation ("MMC") stock and a $60 million gain on the sale of

Chrysler's plastics operations.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's effective tax rates in 1995, 1994 and 1993 were 38.5

percent, 36.3 percent and 37.1 percent, respectively. The provision for income

taxes in 1994 included favorable adjustments aggregating $132 million, including

$100 million for the recognition of tax credits related to expenditures in prior

years for qualifying research and development activities. The 1993 provision for

income taxes included a favorable adjustment of Chrysler's deferred tax assets

and liabilities resulting from an increased U.S. federal tax rate.

<CENTER><h4>

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h4>

<BR></CENTER>

<P>

     Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

totaled $8.1 billion at December 31, 1995 (including $1.2 billion held by CFC

and Car Rental Operations), compared with $8.4 billion at December 31, 1994

(including $756 million held by CFC and Car Rental Operations). At December 31,

1995, $394 million of CFC's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable

securities were limited for use in its insurance operations in accordance with

various statutory requirements. The decrease in Chrysler's consolidated combined

cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in 1995 was the result of

capital expenditures, net finance receivables acquired and common stock

repurchases, largely offset by cash generated by operating activities and cash

provided by an increase in long-term debt. The increase in Chrysler's

consolidated combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $3.3

billion in 1994 was the result of cash generated by operating activities,

partially offset by capital expenditures and pension contributions.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's long-term profitability will depend significantly on its

ability to continue its capital expenditure and vehicle development programs and

market its vehicles successfully. Chrysler's expenditures for new product

development and the acquisition of productive assets were $14.9 billion for the

three-year period ended December 31, 1995. Expenditures for these items during

the succeeding three-year period are expected to be at similar or higher levels.

At December 31, 1995, Chrysler had commitments for capital expenditures,

including commitments for assets currently under construction, totaling

approximately $1.2 billion.

<BR>

<P>

     In December 1994, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved a $1 billion

common stock repurchase program commencing in the first quarter of 1995. In

September 1995, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved an increase in the

program to $2 billion to be completed by the end of 1996, depending on market

conditions. During 1995, Chrysler repurchased 23 million shares of its common

stock under this program at a cost of $1.1 billion (including $23 million in

unsettled repurchases). In addition, holders of the Series A Convertible

Preferred Stock converted 1.6 million shares of preferred stock into 44.1

million shares of common stock during 1995.

<BR>

<P>

     In the second quarter of 1995, Chrysler increased its quarterly

dividend from $0.40 to $0.50 per common share. In the fourth quarter of 1995,

Chrysler increased its quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.60 per common share,

the <A HREF="http://www.investor-rel.com/chrysler/news/divdates.html">

highest dividend rate in Chrysler's history</A>.

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995, Chrysler (excluding CFC) had aggregate debt

maturities of $469 million through 1998. During 1995, Chrysler redeemed its $300

million 13% Debentures Due 1997 and repaid $185 million of other debt. In

December 1995, Thrifty Rent-A-Car System, Inc. issued $450 million of long-term

debt ($190 million of 6.6% notes and $260 million of floating rate notes, which

at December 31, 1995 had a weighted average interest rate of 6.7%). At December

31, 1995, Chrysler had a $1.7 billion revolving credit agreement, which expires

in July 1999. None of the commitment was drawn upon at December 31, 1995.

Chrysler believes that cash from operations and its cash position will be

sufficient to enable it to meet its capital expenditure, debt maturity, common

stock repurchase, dividend payment and other funding requirements.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's ability to market its products successfully depends

significantly on the availability of vehicle financing for its dealers and, to a

lesser extent, the availability of financing for retail and fleet customers,

both of which are provided by CFC.

<BR>

<P>

     Term debt, commercial paper and receivable sales are CFC's primary

funding sources. CFC increased its term debt outstanding by $3.1 billion and

$880 million during 1995 and 1994, respectively. CFC's commercial paper

outstanding decreased by $1.9 billion during 1995 and increased by $1.5 billion

in 1994. CFC realized $6.5 billion and $6.4 billion of net proceeds from the

sales of automotive retail receivables during 1995 and

1994, respectively. In addition, securitization of revolving wholesale account

balances provided funding for CFC, which aggregated $6.7 billion and $3.8

billion at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995, CFC had debt maturities of $4.1 billion in 1996

(including $2.4 billion of short-term notes), $3.0 billion in 1997, and $2.1

billion in 1998. During the second quarter of 1995, CFC entered into new

revolving credit facilities, which replaced its existing U.S. and Canadian

revolving credit and

receivable sale facilities. The new facilities, which total $8.0 billion,

consist of a $2.4 billion facility expiring in May 1996 and a $5.6 billion

facility expiring in May 2000. As of December 31, 1995, no amounts were

outstanding under these facilities. CFC believes that cash provided by

operations, receivable sales, access to term debt markets and the issuance of

commercial paper will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its debt maturity and

other funding requirements.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's strategy is to focus on its core automotive business. As

part of this strategy, Chrysler has sold certain assets and businesses in past

years which are not related to its core automotive business, and is exploring

the sale of other such assets and businesses in the near term.

<CENTER><h4>

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

</h4>

<BR>

</CENTER>

<P>

     In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for

the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed

Of," effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. This

Statement establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived

assets, certain identifiable intangibles, and goodwill related to those assets

to be held and used and long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles

to be disposed of. The Statement requires that long-lived assets and certain

identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for

impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the

carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, the Statement

requires that certain long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles to be

disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost

to sell. Chrysler believes that the implementation of this new accounting

standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated operating results

or financial position. Chrysler will adopt this accounting standard on January

1, 1996, as required.

<BR>

<P>

     In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for

Stock-Based Compensation," effective for fiscal years beginning after December

15, 1995. This Statement encourages entities to use a fair value based method of

accounting for stock-based compensation plans. This Statement also requires

certain disclosures about stock-based employee compensation arrangements

regardless of the method used to account for them. Pro forma disclosures are

required for entities that continue to apply the provisions of Accounting

Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." The

pro forma amounts will reflect the difference between compensation cost, if any,

included in net income and the related cost measured by the fair value based

method as defined in this Statement, including tax effects, if any, that would

have been recognized in the income statement if the fair value method had been

used. Chrysler intends to adopt this Statement on a disclosure only basis.

Chrysler will adopt this accounting standard on January 1, 1996, as

required.

<h4>

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

</h4>





<STRONG>

<EM>Consolidation and Financial Statement Presentation

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The consolidated financial statements of Chrysler Corporation and its

consolidated subsidiaries ("Chrysler") include the accounts of all significant

majority-owned subsidiaries and entities. Intercompany accounts and transactions

have been eliminated in consolidation. Amounts for 1994 and 1993 have been

reclassified to conform with current period classifications.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Estimates

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The preparation of Chrysler's financial statements in conformity with

generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates

and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and

disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial

statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the

reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Revenue Recognition

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF")

of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") reached a consensus on EITF

Issue 95-1, "Revenue Recognition on Sales with a Guaranteed Minimum Resale

Value." The consensus on EITF Issue 95-1 (the "consensus") affects Chrysler's

accounting treatment for vehicle sales (principally to non-affiliated rental car

companies) for which Chrysler conditionally guarantees the minimum resale value

of the vehicles. In accordance with the consensus, these vehicle sales are

accounted for as operating leases with the related revenues and costs deferred

at the time of shipment. A portion of the deferred revenues and costs is

recognized over the corresponding guarantee period, with the remainder

recognized at the end of the guarantee period. The average guarantee period for

these vehicles is approximately nine months. Chrysler changed its accounting

treatment in accordance with the consensus effective January 1, 1995, which

resulted in the recognition of an after-tax charge of $96 million, or $0.25 per

common share, for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle.

The ongoing effect of this accounting change was not material to 1995

earnings.

<BR>

<P>

     Vehicle and parts sales are generally recognized when such products are

shipped to dealers, except for sales under which Chrysler conditionally

guarantees the minimum resale value of the vehicles. Provisions for sales

allowances and incentives are recognized at the time the related sale is

recognized and are treated as revenue reductions.

<BR>

<P>

     Finance revenue from finance receivables of <A HREF="http://www.chryslerfinancial.com">

Chrysler Financial Corporation</A> ("CFC"), a wholly owned subsidiary, is recognized using the interest

method. Certain loan and lease origination costs are deferred and amortized to

finance revenue over the contractual terms. Recognition of finance revenue is

generally suspended when a loan or lease becomes contractually delinquent for

periods ranging from 60 to 90 days. Finance revenue recognition is resumed when

the loan or lease becomes contractually current, at which time all past due

finance revenue is recognized.

<BR>

<P>

     CFC sells significant amounts of automotive retail and wholesale

receivables in transactions subject to limited recourse provisions. CFC

generally sells its receivables to a trust and remains as servicer, for which it

is paid a servicing fee. Normal servicing fees are earned on a level yield basis

over the remaining terms of the related sold receivables. In a subordinated

capacity, CFC retains excess servicing cash flows, a limited interest

in the principal balances of the sold receivables and certain cash deposits

provided as credit enhancements for investors. Gains or losses from the sales of

retail receivables are recognized in the period in which such sales occur. In

determining the gain or loss for each qualifying sale of retail receivables, the

investment in the sold receivable pool is allocated between the portion sold and

the portion retained, based on their relative fair values on the date of

sale.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Depreciation and Tool Amortization

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated

depreciation. Depreciation is generally provided on a straight-line basis. At

December 31, 1995, the weighted average service lives of assets were 34 years

for buildings (including improvements and building equipment), 14 years for

machinery and equipment and 10 years for furniture and fixtures. Special tooling

costs are amortized over the years that a model using that tooling is expected

to be produced, and within each year based on the units produced. Amortization

is deducted directly from the asset account. During any given model year,

special tools will contain tooling with varying useful lives.

<BR>

<P>

     Effective April 1, 1994, Chrysler revised the estimated service lives

of certain special tools and property and equipment. These revisions were based

on updated assessments of the service lives of the related assets and resulted

in the recognition of additional amortization of special tools of $246 million

in 1994 and lower depreciation of property and equipment of $45 million in

1994.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Product-Related Costs

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and other product-related

costs are expensed as incurred. Provisions for product warranty costs are

recognized at the time the related sale is recognized. Advertising expense was

$1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $858 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,

respectively. Research and development costs were $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and

$1.2 billion in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Cash and Cash Equivalents

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at

the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Marketable Securities

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Effective January 1, 1994, Chrysler adopted Statement of Financial

Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in

Debt and Equity Securities." Adoption of this accounting standard did not have a

material effect on Chrysler's financial statements.

<BR>

<P>

     Under SFAS No. 115, debt and equity securities with readily

determinable fair values are segregated into one of the following categories --

trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Trading securities and

available-for-sale securities are carried at their fair values. Changes in the

fair values of trading securities are recorded in the statement of earnings.

Changes in the fair values of available-for-sale securities are recognized as a

component of shareholders' equity until such securities are sold.

Held-to-maturity securities are carried at cost adjusted for amortized premium

or discount.

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995 and 1994, Chrysler had investments in securities

(including cash equivalents) with an aggregate carrying value of $7.3 billion

and $7.9 billion, respectively, accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 115.

These securities consisted primarily of commercial paper, federal government

agency securities and corporate debt. At December 31, 1995, securities

categorized as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity totaled $6.6 billion and

$677 million, respectively. At December 31, 1994, securities categorized as

available-for-sale and held-to-maturity totaled $5.5 billion and $2.4 billion,

respectively. Substantially all such securities have maturities within one

year.

<BR>

<P>

     On December 29, 1995, CFC transferred all of its securities classified

as held-to-maturity to available-for-sale. At the date of transfer, the

amortized cost and unrealized gain of the securities transferred totaled $283

million and $9 million, respectively. This transfer resulted from CFC conducting

a one-time reassessment of the classification of securities held in accordance

with FASB Special Report, "A Guide to Implementation of Statement 115 on

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Allowance for Credit Losses

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     An allowance for credit losses is generally established during the

period in which receivables or vehicle leases are acquired. The allowance for

credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate, based primarily on

loss experience. Other factors affecting collectibility are also evaluated and

appropriate adjustments are recorded. Retail automotive receivables and vehicle

leases not supported by a dealer guaranty are charged to the allowance for

credit losses net of the estimated value of repossessed collateral at the time

of repossession. Nonautomotive finance receivables are reduced to the estimated

fair value of the collateral when such loans are deemed to be impaired.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Inventories

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost of

approximately 42 percent and 51 percent of inventories at December 31, 1995 and

1994, respectively, was determined on a Last-In, First-Out ("LIFO") basis. The

balance of inventory cost was determined on a First-In, First-Out ("FIFO")

basis.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Intangible Assets

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The purchase price of companies in excess of the value of net

identifiable assets acquired ("goodwill") is amortized on a straight-line basis

over periods of up to 40 years. The amount is reported net of accumulated

amortization of $767 million and $723 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994,

respectively. Chrysler periodically evaluates the carrying value of goodwill for

impairment. Such evaluations are based principally on the projected,

undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the goodwill relates.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Postemployment Benefits

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Effective January 1, 1993, Chrysler adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers'

Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which required the accrual of benefits

provided to former or inactive employees after employment but prior to

retirement. Prior to 1993, Chrysler accrued for certain of these benefits at the

time an employee's active service ended and expensed certain other benefits on

the basis of cash expenditures. Adoption of this accounting standard resulted in

the recognition of an after-tax charge of $283 million, or $0.82 per common

share, for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Derivative Financial Instruments

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler manages risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates and

currency exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments. Chrysler does

not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

<BR>

<P>

     When Chrysler sells vehicles outside the United States or purchases

components from suppliers outside the United States, transactions are frequently

denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Periodically, Chrysler

initiates hedging activities by entering into currency exchange agreements,

consisting principally of currency forward contracts and purchased options, to

minimize revenue and cost variations which could result from fluctuations in

currency exchange rates. These instruments, consistent with the underlying

purchase or sale commitments, typically mature within two years of origination.

The currency exchange agreements are treated as off-balance sheet financial

instruments, with related gains and losses recorded in the settlement of the

underlying transactions. In the event of an early termination of a currency

exchange agreement designated as a hedge, the gain or loss continues to be

deferred and is included in the settlement of the underlying transaction.

Chrysler also uses written currency options to effectively close out existing

purchased options, both of which are then carried at fair value. Previously

unrecognized gains and losses on the purchased options continue to be deferred

and are included in the settlement of the underlying transaction.

<BR>

<P>

     CFC utilizes interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, forward interest

rate contracts and currency exchange agreements to manage funding costs and

exposure arising from changes in interest and currency exchange rates. Interest

differentials resulting from interest rate swap agreements used to change the

interest rate characteristics of CFC's debt are recorded on an accrual basis as

an adjustment to interest expense. Interest rate swaps are either matched with

specific term debt obligations or with groups of commercial paper on a layered

basis. Forward interest rate contracts are used to manage exposure to

fluctuations in funding costs for anticipated securitizations of retail

receivables. Unrealized gains or losses on forward interest rate contracts that

qualify for hedge accounting treatment are deferred. Unrealized gains or losses

on forward interest rate contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting

treatment are included in other revenues. Realized gains or losses for hedge

instruments are included in the determination of the gain or loss from the

related sales of retail receivables. In the event of an early termination of an

interest rate exchange agreement designated as a hedge, the gain or loss is

deferred and recorded as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining

term of the underlying debt. In addition, CFC enters into currency exchange

agreements to manage its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates

related to specific borrowings denominated in currencies other than the local

currency of the borrowing entity. As a result, such borrowings are translated in

the consolidated balance sheet at the rates of exchange established under the

related currency exchange agreement.

<P>

     Retained interests in sold receivables are generally restricted and

subject to limited recourse provisions. At December 31, 1994, CFC was a party to

an interest rate cap agreement related to $134 million of its retained

interests. At December 31, 1994, CFC was also party to a forward interest rate

contract (notional amount $500 million) to manage its exposure to fluctuations

in funding costs.

     At December 31, 1995, aggregate annual maturities of consolidated debt,

including principal payments on capital leases, were as follows (in millions of

dollars): 1996-$4,335; 1997-$2,973; 1998-$2,354; 1999-$1,804; and 2000-$925.

<P>

     CFC enters into currency exchange agreements to manage its exposure to

fluctuations in currency exchange rates related to specific borrowings

denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the borrowing entity.

As a result, such borrowings are translated in the consolidated balance sheet at

the rates of

exchange established under the related currency exchange agreement. The reported

amount of such borrowings was $330 million. If CFC had not entered into currency

exchange agreements, the amount would have been $175 million higher at December

31, 1995.

<BR>

<P>

     To mitigate risks associated with changing interest rates on certain of

its debt, CFC has entered into interest rate exchange agreements. CFC manages

exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into such agreements only with

major financial institutions that are expected to fully perform under the terms

of such agreements. The notional amounts are used to measure the volume of these

agreements and do not represent exposure to credit loss. The impact of interest

rate exchange agreements on interest expense was immaterial in 1995, 1994 and

1993.

     During the second quarter of 1995, CFC entered into new revolving

credit facilities which replaced its existing U.S. and Canadian revolving credit

and receivable sale facilities. The new facilities, which total $8.0 billion,

consist of a $2.4 billion facility expiring in May 1996 and a $5.6 billion

facility expiring in May 2000. As of December 31, 1995, no amounts were

outstanding under these facilities.

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995, Chrysler had a $1.7 billion revolving credit

agreement which expires in July 1999. None of the commitment was drawn upon at

December 31, 1995.

     Chrysler's tax credit carryforwards expire at various dates through the

year 2009; alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration

dates. NOL carryforwards totaled $218 million at December 31, 1995, and may be

used through the year 2008. The valuation allowance was principally related to a

subsidiary's NOL carryforwards. Changes in the valuation allowance were as

<h4>Note 8. Commitments, Contingencies and Concentrations</h4>





<STRONG>

<EM>Litigation

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Various claims and legal proceedings have been asserted or instituted

against Chrysler, including some purporting to be class actions, and some which

demand large monetary damages or other relief which could

result in significant expenditures. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties,

and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance. It is

reasonably possible that the final resolution of some of these matters may

require Chrysler to make expenditures, in excess of established reserves, over

an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that cannot be reasonably

estimated. The term "reasonably possible" is used

herein to mean that the chance of a future transaction or event occurring is

more than remote but less than likely. Although the final resolution of any such

matters could have a material effect on Chrysler's consolidated operating

results for the particular reporting period in which an adjustment of the

estimated liability is recorded, Chrysler believes that any resulting liability

should not materially affect its consolidated financial position.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Environmental Matters

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler is subject to potential liability under government regulations

and various claims and legal actions which are pending or may be asserted

against Chrysler concerning environmental matters. Estimates of future costs of

such environmental matters are necessarily imprecise due to numerous

uncertainties, including the enactment of new laws and regulations, the

development and application of new technologies, the identification of new sites

for which Chrysler may have remediation responsibility and the apportionment and

collectibility of remediation costs among responsible parties. Chrysler

establishes reserves for these environmental matters when the loss is probable

and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that final resolution of

some of these matters may require Chrysler to make significant expenditures, in

excess of established reserves, over an extended period of time and in a range

of amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated. Although the final resolution of

any such matters could have a material effect on Chrysler's consolidated

operating results for the particular reporting period in which an adjustment of

the estimated liability is recorded, Chrysler believes that any resulting

liability should not materially affect its consolidated financial position.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Possible Disposition of Assets and Businesses

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's strategy is to focus on its core automotive business. As

part of this strategy, Chrysler has sold certain assets and businesses in past

years which are not related to its core automotive business, and is exploring

the sale of other such assets and businesses in the near term. Although Chrysler

cannot reasonably estimate the gains or losses that may result from the sales of

such assets and businesses, if any, such gains or losses could have a material

effect on Chrysler's consolidated operating results. However, Chrysler believes

that such gains or losses should not materially affect its consolidated

financial position.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Concentrations

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995, Chrysler had a total of approximately 126,000

employees worldwide. Of this total, approximately 85,000 hourly workers and

29,000 salaried workers were employed in the U.S. and Canada. In the U.S. and

Canada, approximately 95 percent of Chrysler's hourly employees and 22 percent

of its salaried employees are represented by unions. Of these represented

employees, 97 percent of hourly and 90 percent of salaried employees are

represented by the United Automotive, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement

Workers of America ("UAW") or the National Automobile, Aerospace, and

Agricultural Implement Workers of Canada ("CAW"). The existing national

agreements with the UAW and CAW will expire in September of 1996.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

<EM>Other Matters

</STRONG></EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The majority of Chrysler's lease payments are for operating leases. At

December 31, 1995, Chrysler had the following minimum rental commitments under

noncancelable operating leases: 1996-$341 million; 1997-$182 million; 1998-$99

million; 1999-$77 million; 2000-$61 million; and 2001 and thereafter-$201

million. Future minimum lease commitments have not been reduced by minimum

sublease rentals of $218 million due in the future under noncancelable

subleases.

<BR>

<P>

     Rental expense for operating leases with original expiration dates

beyond one year was $436 million, $407 million and $410 million in 1995, 1994

and 1993, respectively. Sublease rentals of $58 million, $60 million, and $61

million were received in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler had commitments for capital expenditures, including

commitments for assets currently under construction, approximating $1.2 billion

at December 31, 1995.

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995, Chrysler had guaranteed obligations of others in

the amount of $301 million, none of which were secured by collateral.

<h4>

Note 9. Stock Options and Performance-Based Compensation

</h4>



     The Chrysler Corporation 1991 Stock Compensation Plan (the "1991 Plan")

provides that Chrysler may grant stock options to officers, key employees and

nonemployee directors and also may grant reload stock options (which are options

granted when outstanding options are exercised by payment in stock), stock

appreciation rights (payable in cash or stock, at the sole discretion of the

Stock Option Committee) and limited stock appreciation rights (payable in cash

in the event of a change in control). The 1991 Plan also provides for awarding

restricted stock units and performance stock units, which reward service for

specified periods or attainment of performance objectives. The Chrysler

Corporation Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), initially adopted in 1972 and

readopted in 1982, was amended to incorporate certain features of the 1991

Plan.

<BR>

<P>

     Under the Plan and the 1991 Plan, outstanding options, consisting of

ten-year nonqualified stock options, have exercise prices of not less than the

market value of Chrysler common stock at the date of grant. Options generally

become exercisable on up to 40 percent of the shares after one year from the

date of grant, 70 percent after two years and 100 percent after three years.

Information with respect to options granted under the Plan and the 1991 Plan,

including the conversion of American Motors Corporation ("AMC") options

outstanding at the date of the AMC acquisition, was as follows:

<P>

     Shares available for granting options at the end of 1995, 1994 and 1993

were 11.2 million, 15.1 million, and 1.5 million, respectively. At December 31,

1995, 6.2 million options with prices ranging from $43.19 to $57.00 were not yet

exercisable under the terms of the Plan and the 1991 Plan.

<BR>

<P>

     In addition to the Plan and the 1991 Plan, Chrysler has programs under

which additional compensation is paid to hourly and salaried employees based

upon various measures of Chrysler's performance. Such performance-based

compensation programs include incentive compensation and profit sharing paid to

certain hourly and salaried employees.

* Less than $1 million

<BR>

<P>

     During December 1994, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved a $1

billion common stock repurchase program commencing in the first quarter of 1995.

In 1995, Chrysler's Board of Directors approved an increase in the program to $2

billion to be completed by the end of 1996, depending on market conditions. In

1995, Chrysler repurchased 23 million shares of its common stock under this

program at a cost of $1,070 million (including $23 million in unsettled

repurchases).

<BR>

<P>

     The annual dividend on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the

"Preferred Stock") is $46.25 per share. The Preferred Stock is convertible,

unless previously redeemed, at a rate (subject to adjustment in certain events)

of 27.78 shares of common stock for each share of Preferred Stock. The Preferred

Stock is not redeemable prior to January 22, 1997. Thereafter, Chrysler may

redeem the Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at $523.13 per share of

Preferred Stock for the period ending December 31, 1997 and thereafter declining

ratably annually to $500.00 per share after December 31, 2001, plus accrued and

unpaid dividends. During 1995, holders of substantially all of the Preferred

Stock converted their shares into shares of common stock.

<BR>

<P>

     In February 1988, the Board of Directors declared and distributed a

dividend of one Preferred Share Purchase Right (a "Right") for each then

outstanding share of Chrysler's common stock and authorized the distribution of

one Right with respect to each subsequently issued share of common stock. Each

Right, as most recently amended, entitles a shareholder to purchase one

one-hundredth of a share of Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock of

Chrysler at a price of $120. The Rights are attached to the common stock and are

not represented by separate certificates or exercisable until the earliest to

occur of (i) 10 days following the time (the "Stock Acquisition Time") of a

public announcement or communication to Chrysler that a person or group of

persons has acquired or obtained the right to acquire 15 percent or more of

Chrysler's outstanding common stock, and (ii) 10 business days after a person or

group of persons announces or commences a tender offer that would result, if

successful, in the bidder owning 15 percent or more of Chrysler's outstanding

common stock. If the acquiring person or group acquires 15 percent or more of

the common stock (except pursuant to a tender offer made for all of Chrysler's

common stock, and determined by Chrysler's independent directors to be fair and

in the best interests of Chrysler and its shareholders) each Right (other than

those held by the acquiror) will entitle its holder to buy, for $120, a number

of shares of Chrysler's common stock having a market value of $240. Similarly,

if after the Stock Acquisition Time, Chrysler is acquired in a merger or other

business combination and is not the surviving corporation, or 50 percent or more

of its assets, cash flow or earning power is sold, each Right (other than those

held by the surviving or acquiring company) will entitle its holder to purchase,

for $120, shares of the surviving or acquiring company having a market value of

$240. Chrysler's directors may redeem the Rights at $0.05 per Right, and may

amend the Rights or extend the time during which the Rights may be redeemed,

only prior to the Stock Acquisition Time. Additionally, at any time after a

person or group acquires 15 percent or more, but less than 50 percent, of

Chrysler's common stock, Chrysler's directors may exchange the Rights (other

than those held by the acquiror), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of

one share of common stock (or a fractional share of preferred stock with

equivalent voting rights) per Right. The Rights will expire on February 22,

1998.

<BR>

<P>

     Of the 1.0 billion shares of authorized common stock at December 31,

1995, 53 million shares were reserved for issuance under Chrysler's various

employee benefit plans and the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

<BR>

<P>

     Primary earnings (loss) per common share amounts were computed by

dividing earnings (loss) after deduction of preferred stock dividends by the

average number of common and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding. Fully

diluted per-common-share amounts assume conversion of the Preferred Stock, the

elimination of the related preferred stock dividend requirement, and the

issuance of common stock for all other potentially dilutive equivalents

outstanding. Fully diluted per-common-share amounts are not applicable for loss

periods.

<H4>Note 11. Pension Plans</H4>



     Chrysler's pension plans provide noncontributory and contributory

benefits. The noncontributory pension plans cover substantially all of the

hourly and salaried employees of Chrysler and certain of its consolidated

subsidiaries. Benefits are based on a fixed rate for each year of service.

Additionally, contributory benefits are provided to substantially all salaried

employees of Chrysler and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries under the

Salaried Employees' Retirement Plan. This plan provides benefits based on the

employee's cumulative contributions, years of service during which employee

contributions were made, and the employee's average salary during the

consecutive five years in which salary was highest in the 15 years preceding

retirement.

<BR>

<P>

     Contributions to the pension trust fund for U.S. plans are in

compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

All pension trust fund assets and income accruing thereon are used solely to pay

pension benefits and administer the plans. Chrysler made pension fund

contributions totaling $838 million in 1995, $2.6 billion in 1994 and $3.5

billion in 1993.

<BR>

<P>

     At December 31, 1995, plan assets were invested in a diversified

portfolio that consisted primarily of debt and equity securities, including 11.9

million shares of Chrysler common stock with a market value of $658 million.

During 1995, $29 million of dividends were received on Chrysler common

stock.

     During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the cost of voluntary early retirement

programs, which are periodically offered to certain salaried and hourly

employees, was $21 million, $68 million and $40 million, respectively, and is

included in pension expense.

     Pension expense is determined using assumptions at the beginning of the

<h4>Note 12. Nonpension Postretirement Benefits</h4>





     Chrysler provides health and life insurance benefits to substantially

all of its hourly and salaried employees and those of certain of its

consolidated subsidiaries. Upon retirement from Chrysler, employees may become

eligible for continuation of these benefits. However, benefits and eligibility

rules may be modified periodically. Prior to 1993, the expense recognized for

these benefits was based primarily on cash expenditures for the period.

Effective January 1, 1993, Chrysler adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting

for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which requires the accrual of

such benefits during the years employees provide services. The adoption of this

accounting standard resulted in an after-tax charge of $4.7 billion, or $13.57

per common share, in 1993. Implementation of SFAS No. 106 did not increase

Chrysler's cash expenditures for postretirement benefits.

     The decrease in the discount rate from 8.6 percent to 7.0 percent as of

December 31, 1995 resulted in a $1.6 billion increase in the ANPBO in 1995, and

     A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care inflation

rate in each year would have increased the ANPBO at December 31, 1995 by $1.2

components of nonpension postretirement benefit expense in 1995 by $105

million.

<h4>Note 13. Sales of Automotive Assets and Investments</h4>



     During 1994, Chrysler sold its wire harness operations and certain of

its soft trim operations, and entered into five-year supply agreements with each

of the purchasers. Aggregate net proceeds from the sales and the supply

agreements were $315 million. The related pretax gains of $254 million were

deferred and are being recognized over the periods of the respective supply

agreements.

<BR>

<P>

     In 1993, Chrysler sold its plastics operations for net proceeds of $132

million. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $60 million ($39 million after

income taxes). Also during 1993, Chrysler sold its remaining 50.3 million shares

of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation stock for net proceeds of $329 million,

resulting in a pretax gain of $205 million ($128 million after income

taxes).

<h4>Note 14. Special Plant Provision</h4>



     During 1995, Chrysler recorded a $263 million provision ($162 million

after income taxes) for costs associated with production changes at its Newark

assembly plant. The plant ended production of Chrysler's LeBaron convertibles in

July 1995. In addition, Newark production of the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge

Intrepid was reduced to one shift in August 1995 and will end prior to

production of a new vehicle in the fall of 1997. The provision includes the

recognition of supplemental unemployment benefits, job security benefits and

other related employee costs, and the write-down of certain equipment and

tooling. The provision is included in Costs, other than items below in the

consolidated statement of earnings.

<h4>Note 16. Financial Instruments</h4>



     The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined

by Chrysler using available market information and the valuation methodologies

described below. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting

market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates

presented herein may not be indicative of the amounts that Chrysler could

realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions or

valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value

amounts.

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The carrying value of variable-rate finance receivables was assumed to

approximate fair value since they are priced at current market rates. The fair

value of fixed-rate finance receivables was estimated by discounting expected

cash flows using rates at which loans of similar maturities would be made as of

the date of the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of excess servicing

cash flows and other subordinated amounts due CFC arising from receivable sale

transactions were estimated by discounting expected cash flows.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Debt

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The fair value of public debt was estimated using quoted market prices.

The fair value of other long-term debt was estimated by discounting future cash

flows using rates currently available for debt with similar terms and remaining

maturities.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Currency exchange agreements

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The fair values of currency exchange agreements were estimated by

discounting the expected cash flows using market exchange rates and relative

market interest rates over the remaining terms of the agreements. Currency

exchange agreements are more fully described in Notes 1 and 6.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Interest rate exchange agreements

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward

interest rate contracts were estimated by discounting expected cash flows using

quoted market interest rates. Interest rate exchange agreements are more fully

described in Notes 1, 3 and 6.

<BR>

<P>

<STRONG>

</STRONG><EM>Currency forward and option contracts

</EM>

<BR>

<P>

     The fair values of currency forward and option contracts were estimated

based on quoted market prices for contracts of similar terms. Currency forward

and option contracts are more fully described in Note 1.

<BR>

<P>

     Although not a counterparty to certain derivative financial instruments

entered into between securitization trusts and third parties, CFC receives an

indirect beneficial interest from such instruments.

<BR>

<P>

     The fair value estimates presented herein were based on information

available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. Although management

is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair

value amounts, such amounts have not been revalued since the date of the

consolidated balance sheet and, therefore, current estimates of fair value may

differ from the amounts presented herein.

<h4>Note 17. Industry Segment and Geographic Area Data</h4>



<strong>Industry Segment Data</strong>

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler operates in two principal industry segments: Car and Truck and

Financial Services. The Car and Truck segment is comprised of the automotive

operations of Chrysler, which includes the research, design, manufacture,

assembly and sale of cars, trucks and related parts and accessories. Based on

assets, revenues and earnings, automotive operations represent the majority of

Chrysler's business activities. The Financial Services segment is comprised of

CFC, which is engaged principally in retail and lease financing for vehicles,

dealer inventory and other financing needs, dealer property and casualty

insurance, and dealership facility development and management. Chrysler also

participates in short-term vehicle rental activities through its Car Rental

Operations and engages in aircraft modification and the manufacture of

electronics products and systems through its Chrysler Technologies Corporation

subsidiary ("CTC"). The Car Rental Operations and CTC, each represent less than

10 percent of revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets, and have been

included in the Car and Truck segment. Chrysler's operations are conducted

primarily in North America including the United States, Canada and Mexico.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

</h3>



</CENTER><P>

     Chrysler's management is responsible for preparing the financial

statements and other financial information in this Annual Report. This

responsibility includes maintaining the integrity and objectivity of financial

data and the presentation of Chrysler's results of operations and financial

position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The

financial statements include amounts that are based on management's best

estimates and judgments.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler's financial statements have been audited by 

<A HREF="http://www.dttus.com/">Deloitte & Touche LLP</A>, independent auditors. 

Their audits were conducted in accordance with

generally accepted auditing standards and included consideration of the internal

control system and tests of transactions as part of planning and performing

their audits.

<BR>

<P>

     Chrysler maintains a system of internal controls that provides

reasonable assurance that its records reflect its transactions in all material

respects and that significant misuse or loss of assets will be prevented.

Management believes the system of internal controls is adequate to accomplish

these objectives on a continuous basis. Chrysler maintains a strong internal

auditing program that independently assesses the effectiveness of the internal

controls and recommends possible improvements. Management considers the

recommendations of the General Auditor and Deloitte & Touche LLP concerning the

system of internal controls and takes appropriate actions to respond to these

recommendations.

<BR>

<P>

     The <A HREF="http://www.investor-rel.com/chrysler/annual_report/1995/board.html">

Board of Directors</A>, acting through its Audit Committee composed

solely of nonemployee directors, is responsible for determining that management

fulfills its responsibilities in the preparation of financial statements and the

maintenance of internal controls. In fulfilling its responsibility, the Audit

Committee recommends independent auditors to the Board of Directors for

appointment by the shareholders. The Audit Committee also reviews the

consolidated financial statements and adequacy of internal controls. The Audit

Committee meets regularly with management, the General Auditor and the

independent auditors. Both the independent auditors and the General Auditor have

full and free access to the Audit Committee, without management representatives

present, to discuss the scope and results of their audits and their views on the

adequacy of internal controls and the quality of financial reporting.

<BR>

<P>

     It is the business philosophy of Chrysler to obey the law and to

require that its employees conduct their activities according to the highest

standards of business ethics. Management reinforces this philosophy by numerous

actions, including issuing a Code of Ethical Behavior and maintaining a Business

Practices Committee and a Business Practices Office to support compliance with

Chrysler's policies.

<P>

Shareholders and Board of Directors

<BR>

Chrysler Corporation

<BR>

Auburn Hills, Michigan

<BR>

<P>

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler

Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and

the related consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for each of the

three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial statements

are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to

express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

<BR>

<P>

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing

standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain

reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material

misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting

the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes

assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by

management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<BR>

<P>

     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,

in all material respects, the financial position of Chrysler Corporation and

consolidated subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of

their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period

ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting

principles.

<BR>

<P>

     As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, in 1995 the

Company changed its method of accounting for sales of vehicles for which it has

guaranteed a minimum resale value.

(1)  Previously reported results for the first quarter of 1995 have been

     restated to include a $96 million charge for the cumulative effect of a

     change in accounting principle related to the consensus reached on

     Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 95-1, "Revenue Recognition on

     Sales with a Guaranteed Minimum Resale Value." The ongoing effect of this

     accounting change was not material to Chrysler's 1995 quarterly results.

     First quarter results also included a $115 million pretax charge for a

     voluntary minivan owner service action.<br><p>

(2)  Results for the second quarter of 1995 included a $232 million pretax

     provision for costs associated with production changes at Chrysler's

     Newark, Del., assembly plant. The provision includes the recognition of

     supplemental unemployment benefits, job security benefits and other

     related employee costs, and the write-down of certain equipment and

     tooling. During the third quarter of 1995, this provision was increased by

     $31 million to $263 million, primarily reflecting changes in the estimate

     for job security benefit costs.<br><p>

(3)  Earnings for the fourth quarter of 1994 included favorable adjustments to

     the provision for income taxes aggregating $132 million. These adjustments

     related to: (1) the recognition of tax credits related to expenditures in

     prior years for qualifying research and development activities, in

     accordance with an Internal Revenue Service settlement which was based on

     U.S. Department of Treasury income tax regulations issued in 1994, and (2)

     the reversal of valuation allowances related to tax benefits associated

     with net operating loss carryforwards.<br><p>

This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental Operations on

an Equity Basis)," reflects the results of operations of Chrysler with its

investments in <A HREF="http://www.chryslerfinancial.com/">Chrysler Financial Corporation</A>

 ("CFC") and its investments in

short-term vehicle rental subsidiaries (the "Car Rental Operations") accounted

for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries. This

Supplemental Information does not purport to present results of operations in

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because it does not

comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 94,

"Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." Because the operations of

CFC and the Car Rental Operations are different in nature than Chrysler's

manufacturing operations, management believes that this disaggregated financial

data enhances an understanding of the consolidated financial statements.

This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental Operations on

an Equity Basis)," reflects the financial position of Chrysler with its

investments in CFC and the Car Rental Operations accounted for on an equity

basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries. This Supplemental Information

does not purport to present financial position in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles because it does not comply with SFAS No. 94,

"Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries." The financial covenant

contained in Chrysler's revolving credit facility is based on this Supplemental

Information. In addition, because the operations of CFC and the Car Rental

Operations are different in nature than Chrysler's manufacturing operations,

management believes that this disaggregated financial data enhances an

understanding of the consolidated financial statements.

<h3><center>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF<br>

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</center></h3>

<p>

        The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with

the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.



<h4>FINANCIAL REVIEW</h4>

<p>

        Chrysler reported earnings before income taxes and the cumulative effect

of changes in accounting principles of $5.8 billion in 1994, compared with $3.8

billion in 1993.  The earnings in 1993 included a gain on sales of automotive

assets and investments totaling $265 million.  Excluding the effects of these

items, Chrysler's pretax earnings for 1993 were $3.6 billion.

<p>

        Chrysler reported net earnings for 1994 of $3.7 billion, or $10.11 per

common share, compared to a net loss for 1993 of $2.6 billion, or $7.62 per

common share.  Net earnings for 1994 included favorable tax adjustments

aggregating $132 million.  The net loss for 1993 resulted from a charge of $4.68

billion, or $13.57 per common share, for the cumulative effect of a change in

accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 106, "Employers'

Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  Also included in

the 1993 results was a charge of $283 million, or $0.82 per common share, for

the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relating to the

adoption of SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits"

and a $72 million favorable adjustment of Chrysler's deferred tax assets and

liabilities as a result of the increased U.S. federal income tax rate.

<p>

        The improvement in earnings in 1994 over 1993 was primarily the result

of an increase in sales volume, a reduction in lower-margin fleet sales in

proportion to total retail sales and reduced sales incentives, partially offset

by increased profit-based employee costs.  During 1994, Chrysler's worldwide

factory sales of cars increased 2 percent to 1,051,750 units, while worldwide

factory sales of trucks increased 18 percent to 1,710,353 units.  Combined U.S.

and Canadian dealers' days supply of vehicles increased to 69 days at December

31, 1994 from 63 days at December 31, 1993.

<p>

        During 1994, U.S. and Canada vehicle industry retail sales were 16.7

million cars and trucks, an increase of 8 percent from the 15.4 million units

sold in 1993.  Despite an increase in its combined car and truck sales,

Chrysler's U.S. and Canada retail market share in 1994 decreased slightly in

comparison to 1993. Decreases in car market share were partially offset by

increases in truck market share, as shown below:

<p>

(1)  All retail sale and market share data include fleet sales.

<p>

        The decline in Chrysler's U.S. car market share during 1994 resulted

from reduced sales to fleet customers and reduced sales in certain segments

resulting from changeovers to all-new 1995 models.  The increase in U.S. truck

market share in 1994 was the result of increased sales of full-size Dodge Ram

pickup trucks introduced in late 1993.  Despite increased retail unit sales in

1994, market shares in the minivan and small sport-utility segments decreased

slightly from 1993, principally as a result of market demand in excess of

Chrysler's 1994 production capacity for minivans and Jeep(R) vehicles.

<p>

        Chrysler Financial Coporation ("CFC") had earnings before income taxes and the cumulative effect of changes

in accounting principles of $315 million in 1994, compared to $267 million in

1993.  The increase in 1994 was primarily due to higher volumes of automotive

financing, reduced credit loss provisions and lower costs of bank facilities. 

CFC reported net earnings of $195 million and $129 million for 1994 and 1993,

respectively.  CFC's net earnings for 1993 included charges totaling $30 million

for the adoptions of SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 112.

<p>

        During 1994 and 1993, Chrysler continued to take various actions to

strengthen its financial condition, improve liquidity and add to its equity base

in order to ensure its ability to carry out its capital spending plans.  During

1994 and 1993, Chrysler contributed a total of $6.1 billion to its pension fund.

At December 31, 1994, Chrysler had plan assets in excess of its projected

pension benefit obligation ("PBO") of $244 million, compared to a PBO in excess

of plan assets of $3.9 billion at December 31, 1992.  During 1993, Chrysler

issued 52 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $1.95 billion. 

During 1994 and 1993, Chrysler sold assets and investments for proceeds totaling

approximately $786 million.

<p>

        Chrysler's revenues and results of operations are principally derived

from the U.S. and Canada automotive marketplace.  During 1994, combined U.S. and

Canada automobile industry sales increased 8 percent from the 1993 levels, as

the economic recoveries  in the U.S. and Canada continued.  Overall, Chrysler

experienced sales growth consistent with the U.S. and Canada automobile

industry.  In response to the economic recovery, Chrysler is increasing its

worldwide production capacity by approximately 500,000 units per year by 1996.

<p>

        Chrysler vehicles manufactured in Mexico represented approximately 9

percent of Chrysler's 1994 worldwide factory car and truck sales.  Approximately

two-thirds of these vehicles were exported to the U.S., Canada and other

markets.  Sales in Mexico of vehicles manufactured in the U.S. and Canada were

not significant in 1994.   The economic uncertainty in Mexico following the

devaluation of the Peso may result in reduced vehicle sales in Mexico in 1995. 

As a result, exports to Mexico of Chrysler vehicles manufactured in the U.S. and

Canada may decrease, and sales of vehicles in Mexico may be less profitable in

1995, as compared to 1994.  If U.S. and Canada vehicle industry sales continue

at present or higher levels, imports to the U.S. and Canada of Chrysler vehicles

manufactured in Mexico may increase, and such sales may be more profitable in

1995, as compared to 1994.  The devaluation of the Peso did not significantly

impact Chrysler's 1994 operating results.  Chrysler cannot predict the impact

that the devaluation of the Peso and the resulting uncertainty surrounding the

Mexican economic and political environments will have on its operating results

in 1995.

<p>

        During the first half of 1995, Chrysler will begin production of its

all-new minivans, and will cease production of its existing minivan models. 

Chrysler expects this changeover will result in a decline in minivan production

in 1995 which Chrysler currently estimates at approximately 65,000 units.

<p>

        Chrysler has benefited from several factors, including:  (1) continuing

economic recoveries (including low interest rates) and strong automobile sales

in the U.S. and Canada, where Chrysler's sales are concentrated, (2) a cost

advantage in comparison to vehicles manufactured in Japan (or vehicles

containing significant material components manufactured in Japan) as a result of

favorable exchange rates between the Japanese Yen and the U.S. Dollar, and  (3)

a shift in U.S. and Canada consumer preferences toward trucks, as Chrysler

manufactures a higher proportion of trucks to total vehicles than its principal

competitors in the U.S. and Canada.  A significant deterioration of any of these

factors could adversely affect Chrysler's operating results.

</pre>

<p>

        The increase in sales of manufactured products in 1994 primarily

reflects the 12 percent increase in factory unit sales to 2,762,103 units in

1994.  The 1993 increase was largely due to a 14 percent increase in factory

unit sales from the 2,175,447 units in 1992.  Average revenue per unit, net of

sales incentives, was $17,663, $16,461 and $15,086 in 1994, 1993 and 1992,

respectively.  The increases in average revenue per unit in 1994 and 1993 were

principally due to reduced sales incentives and sales of an increased proportion

of trucks to total vehicles.



<p>

        The decreases in finance and insurance income in 1994 and 1993 were

primarily attributable to reduced nonautomotive financing revenue, resulting

from sales and liquidations of CFC's nonautomotive receivables, partially offset

by increased levels of automotive finance receivables.  Total automotive

financing volume in 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $70.4 billion, $59.8 billion and

$46.6 billion, respectively.  The increases in automotive financing volume over

the last two years were largely due to higher volumes of wholesale financing

provided to automotive dealers.  Financing support provided in the United States

by CFC for new Chrysler vehicle retail deliveries (including fleet) and

wholesale vehicle sales to dealers and the number of vehicles financed during

the last three years were as follows:

<p>

        "Costs, other than items below" increased over the three years primarily

due to the increases in factory unit sales volume. Included in "Costs, other than

items below" in 1992 is a $110 million investment loss for reducing investments

of Chrysler Canada and certain of its employee benefit plans in a real estate

concern to their estimated net realizable value.  Excluding the 1992 investment

loss, "Costs, other than items below" as a percent of net sales of manufactured

products were 77 percent, 79 percent and 84 percent in 1994, 1993 and 1992,

respectively.  These improvements were primarily due to lower per-unit sales

incentives and increased capacity utilization.

<p>

        Depreciation of property and equipment remained comparable in 1994,

1993 and 1992.  Increases  resulting from Chrysler's capital spending program

were offset by reductions at CFC resulting from the sales and downsizing of its

nonautomotive financing operations.  Special tooling amortization increased in

1994 over the 1993 and 1992 levels, primarily as a result of the shortening of

the remaining service lives of certain special tools in 1994. 

<p>

        Selling and administrative expenses increased in 1994 from the 1993 and

1992 levels, as a result of increased advertising costs and increased

profit-based employee costs.  During 1993, increased profit-based employee

costs were offset by reduced costs at CFC due to the downsizing of its

nonautomotive financing operations.

<p>

        

        Pension expense decreased in 1994 due to improved funding of the plans,

partially offset by increases resulting from the reduction in the discount rate

used to measure pension expense in 1994 and benefit increases from Chrysler's

1993 national contracts with its principal bargaining units.  Pension expense

decreased in 1993 due to improved funding of the plans. Contributions during

1994, 1993 and 1992 were $2.6 billion, $3.5 billion and $816 million,

respectively.

<p>

        Nonpension postretirement benefit expense increased slightly in 1994, as

increases resulting from the reduction in the discount rate used to measure

nonpension postretirement benefit expense in 1994 were partially offset by cost

savings associated with the implementation of new managed care initiatives. 

Nonpension postretirement benefit expense increased significantly in 1993 due to

the adoption of SFAS No. 106, which requires that the costs of health and life

insurance benefits for retirees be accrued as expense in the period in which

employees provide services.

<p>

        The decline in interest expense in 1994 was primarily due to reductions

in CFC's effective cost of borrowings, resulting from CFC's higher levels of

commercial paper, which has lower costs than borrowings under CFC's bank

facilities.  The decline in interest expense in 1993 was primarily the result of

CFC's lower average borrowings, reflecting CFC's 1993 sales of its nonautomotive

financing operations, the proceeds from which were used to reduce outstanding

indebtedness.  CFC's average effective cost of borrowings was 8.0 percent, 8.6

percent and 7.8 percent in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The decrease in

CFC's 1994 average effective cost of borrowings reflects lower bank facility

costs and higher levels of commercial paper.  The increase in CFC's average

effective cost of borrowings in 1993 as compared to 1992 was primarily due to

the amortization of up-front fees and costs associated with CFC's former bank

facilities, which were replaced in 1994.

<p>

        The results of operations for 1992 included a restructuring charge of

$101 million relating to the realignment of Chrysler's short-term vehicle rental

subsidiaries under Pentastar Transportation Group and the consolidation and

phase-out of certain of these operations.  This restructuring charge included

the write-down of goodwill, lease termination costs, losses associated with the

disposal of tangible assets, and other related charges.

<p>

        Operating results for 1993 and 1992 included gains on sales of

automotive assets and investments of $265 million and $142 million,

respectively.  The 1993 pretax gain was composed of a $205 million gain on the

sales of an aggregate of 50.3 million shares of Mitsubishi Motor Corporation stock and a $60 million gain

on the sale of Chrysler's plastics operations.  The 1992 pretax gain resulted

from the sale of 43.6 million shares of MMC stock.

<p>

        Chrysler's effective tax rates in 1994, 1993 and 1992 were 36.3 percent,

37.1 percent and 45.9 percent, respectively.  The provision for income taxes in

1994 included adjustments aggregating $132 million for:  (1) the recognition of

tax credits related to expenditures in prior years for qualifying research and

development activities, in accordance with an Internal Revenue Service

settlement which was based on recently issued U.S. Department of Treasury income

tax regulations, and (2) the reversal of valuation allowances related to tax

benefits associated with net operating loss carryforwards.  The 1993 provision

for income taxes included a favorable adjustment of Chrysler's deferred tax

assets and liabilities to the increased U.S. federal tax rate.  The 1992

effective tax rate was higher than the effective tax rates in 1994 and 1993 as a

result of higher nondeductible expenses, primarily goodwill amortization.

<h3>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h3>
</center>
<p>

        Chrysler's combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

totaled $8.4 billion at December 31, 1994 (including $757 million held by CFC),

compared to $5.1 billion and $3.6 billion at December 31, 1993 and 1992,

respectively.  The increase in 1994 was the result of cash generated by

operating activities, partially offset by capital expenditures and pension

contributions.  The increase in 1993 was the result of cash generated by

operating activities, the issuance of 52 million shares of new common stock and

the sale of assets and investments, partially offset by debt repayments, pension

contributions and capital expenditures.

<p>

        Chrysler's long-term profitability will depend on its ability to

develop and market its products successfully.  Chrysler's expenditures for new

product development and the acquisition of productive assets were $13.7 billion

for the three-year period ended December 31, 1994.  Expenditures for these

items during the succeeding three-year period are expected to be at similar or

higher levels.  At December 31, 1994, Chrysler had commitments for capital

expenditures, including commitments for assets currently under construction,

totaling approximately $1.0 billion.



<p>

        Chrysler's pension assets exceeded its PBO by $244 million at December

31, 1994, compared to a PBO in excess of plan assets of $2.2 billion and $3.9

billion at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  These reductions in the

unfunded pension obligation resulted from Chrysler's contributions of $2.6

billion and $3.5 billion to the pension fund in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  In

addition to the contributions in 1994, the projected pension benefit obligation

was reduced by an increase in the discount rate used to measure the

obligation. The favorable impact of the 1993 contributions was partially offset

by increases in the PBO caused by the reduction in the discount rate used to

measure the obligation and pension benefit increases which were included in

Chrysler's new national labor agreements with its principal collective

bargaining units.

<p>

        During 1994, Chrysler replaced its $1.5 billion revolving credit

agreement, which was to expire in June 1996, with a new $1.7 billion agreement,

expiring in July 1999.  The new agreement provides for reduced interest rates

and commitment fees, less restrictive financial covenants and the removal of the

lenders' ability to obtain security interests in Chrysler's assets.  None of the

commitment was drawn upon at December 31, 1994.

<p>

        At December 31, 1994, Chrysler (excluding CFC) had debt maturities

totaling $695 million in 1995, 1996 and 1997.  In December 1994, Chrysler's

Board of Directors approved a $1 billion common stock repurchase program

commencing in the first quarter of 1995, subject to market conditions.  Chrysler

believes that cash from operations and its cash position will provide sufficient

liquidity to meet its capital expenditure, debt maturity and other funding

requirements.

<p>

        Chrysler's ability to market its products successfully depends

significantly on the availability of vehicle financing for its dealers and, to a

lesser extent, the availability of financing for retail and fleet customers,

both of which CFC provides.

<p>

        Term debt borrowings, commercial paper borrowings and receivable sales

are CFC's primary funding sources.  During 1994, CFC raised $1.8 billion from

term debt placements and increased the amount of its commercial paper

outstanding by $1.5 billion.

<p>

        Receivable sales continued to be a significant source of funding for

CFC, which realized $6.4 billion and $7.8 billion of net proceeds from the sale

of automotive retail receivables during 1994 and 1993, respectively.  In

addition, CFC's wholesale receivable sale arrangements provided funding which

aggregated $3.8 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 1994 and 1993,

respectively.

<p>

        During 1993 and 1992, $3.3 billion in aggregate cash proceeds were

received from the sale of substantially all of the net assets of the consumer

and inventory financing businesses of Chrysler First Inc. and the sale of

certain assets of Chrysler Capital.  Proceeds from these sales were used to

reduce outstanding indebtedness.

<p>

        At December 31, 1994, CFC had U.S. and Canadian bank facilities

aggregating $5.2 billion and receivable sale agreements totaling $1.7 billion. 

At December 31, 1994, no amounts were outstanding under CFC's U.S. and Canadian

bank facilities or receivable sale agreements.

<p>

        At December 31, 1994, CFC had debt maturities of $5.1 billion in 1995

(including $4.3 billion of commercial paper), $1.7 billion in 1996, and $692

million in 1997.  CFC believes that cash provided by operations, receivable

sales and the issuance of term debt and commercial paper will be sufficient to

enable it to meet its funding requirements.

<h3>NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS</h3></center>
<p>

        In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued

SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," effective for

fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994.  In October 1994, the FASB

issued SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan--Income

Recognition and Disclosures," as an amendment to SFAS No. 114.  These new

accounting standards require creditors to evaluate the collectibility of both

contractual interest and principal of receivables when evaluating the need for a

loss accrual. Chrysler believes that the implementation of these new accounting

standards will not have a material impact on its consolidated operating results

or financial position.  Chrysler will adopt these standards effective January 1,

1995, as required.

<h4>NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h4>



<h5>Consolidation and Financial Statement Presentation</h5>

<p>

        The consolidated financial statements of Chrysler Corporation and its

consolidated subsidiaries ("Chrysler") include the accounts of all significant

majority-owned subsidiaries and entities.  Intercompany accounts and

transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Amounts for 1993 and 1992

have been reclassified to conform with current period classifications.



<h5>Revenue Recognition

</h5>

<p>

        Vehicle and parts sales are generally recorded when such products are

shipped to dealers.  Provisions for sales allowances and incentives are made at

the time of sale and treated as sales reductions.

<p>

        Interest income from finance receivables of Chrysler Financial

Corporation ("CFC"), a wholly owned subsidiary, is recognized using the

interest method.  Lending fees and certain direct loan origination costs are

deferred and amortized to interest income using the interest method over the

contractual terms of the finance receivables.  Recognition of interest income

is generally suspended when a loan becomes contractually delinquent for periods

ranging from 60 to 90 days.  Income recognition is resumed when the loan

becomes contractually current, at which time all past due interest income is    

recognized.

<p>

        CFC sells significant amounts of automotive receivables in transactions

subject to limited recourse provisions.  CFC generally sells its receivables to

a trust and remains as servicer, for which it is paid a servicing fee.  CFC

retains excess servicing cash flows, a limited interest in the principal

balances of the sold receivables and certain cash deposits provided as credit

enhancements for investors.

<p>

        Gains or losses from the sale of receivables are recognized in the

period that such sales occur.  In determining the gain or loss for each

qualifying sale, the investment in the sold receivable pool is allocated between

the portion sold and the portion retained based on their relative fair values on

the date of sale. 



<h5>Depreciation and Tool Amortization</h5>

<p>

        Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated

depreciation.  Depreciation is generally provided on a straight-line basis.  At

December 31, 1994, the weighted average service lives of assets were 34 years

for buildings (including improvements and building equipment), 14 years for

machinery and equipment and 11 years for furniture and fixtures.  Special

tooling costs are amortized over the years that a model using that tooling is

expected to be produced, and within each year based on the units produced. 

Amortization is deducted directly from the asset account.  During any given

model year, special tools will contain tooling with varying useful lives.

<p>

        Effective April 1, 1994, Chrysler revised the estimated service lives of

certain special tools and property and equipment.  These revisions were based on

updated assessments of the service lives of the related assets and resulted in

the recognition of additional amortization of special tools of $246 million in

1994 and lower depreciation of property and equipment of $45 million in 1994.



<h5>Product-Related Costs</h5>

<p>

        Expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and other product-related

costs are expensed as incurred, and the estimated costs of product warranty are

accrued at the time of sale. Advertising expense  was $1.1 billion, $858 million

and $873 million in 1994,  1993 and 1992, respectively.  Research and

development costs were $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 1994, 1993

and 1992, respectively.



<h5>Cash and Cash Equivalents</h5>

<p>

        Highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the

date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.







<h5>Marketable Securities

</h5>

<p>

        Effective January 1, 1994, Chrysler adopted Statement of Financial

Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in

Debt and Equity Securities."  This new accounting standard specifies the

accounting and reporting requirements for changes in the fair values of

investments in debt and equity securities which have readily determinable fair

values.  Prior to 1994, marketable equity securities were carried at cost, which

approximated market, while debt securities were carried at cost adjusted for

amortized premium or discount. Adoption of this accounting standard did not have

a material effect on Chrysler's financial statements.

<p>

        Under SFAS No. 115, these debt and equity securities are segregated into

one of the following categories--trading, available-for-sale and

held-to-maturity.  Trading securities and available-for-sale securities are

carried at their fair values. Changes in the fair values of trading securities

are recorded in the statement of earnings.  Changes in the fair values of

available-for-sale securities are recorded as a component of shareholders'

equity until such securities are sold.  Held-to-maturity securities are carried

at cost adjusted for amortized premium or discount.

<p>

        At December 31, 1994, Chrysler had investments in securities (including

cash equivalents) with an aggregate carrying value of $7.9 billion accounted for

in accordance with SFAS No. 115. These securities consisted primarily of

commercial paper, federal government agency securities and corporate debt.  At

December 31, 1994, securities categorized as available-for-sale and held-to-

maturity totaled $5.5 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. Substantially all

such securities have maturities within one year.



<h5>Allowance for Credit Losses</h5>

<p>

        An allowance for credit losses is generally established during the

period in which finance receivables are acquired.  The allowance for credit

losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate based on loss experience and

other factors.  Retail automotive receivables not supported by a dealer guaranty

are charged to the allowance for credit losses net of the estimated value of

repossessed collateral at the time of repossession. Nonautomotive finance

receivables are reduced to the estimated fair value of the collateral when such

receivables are determined to be impaired.

<p>

        In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued

SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," effective for

fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994.  In October 1994, the FASB

issued SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan--Income

Recognition and Disclosures," as an amendment to SFAS No. 114.  These new

accounting standards require creditors to evaluate the collectibility of both

contractual interest and principal of receivables when evaluating the need for a

loss accrual. Chrysler believes that the implementation of these new accounting

standards will not have a material impact on its consolidated operating results

or financial position.  Chrysler will adopt these standards effective January 1,

1995, as required.



<h5>Inventories</h5>

<p>

        Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  The cost of

approximately 51 percent and 44 percent of inventories at December 31, 1994 and

1993, respectively, was determined on a Last-In, First-Out ("LIFO") basis.  The

balance of inventory cost was determined on a First-In, First-Out ("FIFO")

basis.



<h5>Intangible Assets</h5>

<p>

        The purchase price of companies in excess of the value of net

identifiable assets acquired ("goodwill") is amortized on a straight-line basis

over periods of up to 40 years.  The amount is reported net of accumulated

amortization of $723 million and $643 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993,

respectively. Intangible assets also included intangible pension assets of $44

million and $2.1 billion at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.





<h5>Postemployment Benefits</h5>

<p>

        Effective January 1, 1993, Chrysler adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers'

Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which required the accrual of benefits

provided to former or inactive employees after employment but prior to

retirement.  Prior to 1993, Chrysler accrued for certain of these benefits at

the time an employee's active service ended and expensed certain other benefits

on the basis of cash expenditures.  Adoption of this accounting standard

resulted in the recognition of an after-tax charge of $283 million, or $0.82 per

common share, for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle.



<h5>Derivative Financial Instruments</h5>

<p>

        Chrysler manages risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates and

currency exchange rates by utilizing derivative financial instruments.  Chrysler

does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.  For the

year ended December 31, 1994, Chrysler adopted SFAS No. 119, "Disclosure about

Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments."

<p>

        When Chrysler sells vehicles outside the United States or purchases

components from suppliers outside the United States, transactions are frequently

denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.  Periodically, Chrysler

initiates hedging activities by entering into currency exchange agreements,

consisting principally of currency forward contracts and purchased currency

options, to minimize revenue and cost variations which could result from

fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  These hedge instruments typically

mature within two years of origination.  The currency exchange agreements are

treated as off-balance sheet financial instruments, with related gains and

losses recorded in the settlement of the underlying transactions.  In the event

of an early termination of a currency exchange agreement designated as a hedge,

the gain or loss continues to be deferred and is included in the settlement of

the underlying transaction.

<p>

        CFC utilizes interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, forward interest

rate contracts and currency exchange agreements as part of its asset and

liability management program.  Due to changing interest rates, interest rate

exchange agreements, which are treated as off-balance sheet financial

instruments, are utilized to stabilize interest margins.  Interest differentials

resulting from interest rate swap and cap agreements are recorded on an accrual

basis as an adjustment to interest expense.  In the event of an early

termination of an interest rate exchange agreement designated as a hedge, gains

or losses are deferred and recorded as an adjustment to interest expense over

the remaining term of the underlying debt.  Forward interest rate contracts are

periodically used to manage exposure to fluctuations in funding costs for

anticipated securitizations of retail receivables. Unrealized gains or losses on

forward interest rate contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are

deferred. Unrealized gains or losses on forward interest rate contracts that do

not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are included in the statement of

earnings.  Realized gains or losses for hedge instruments are included in the

determination of the gain or loss from the related sale of retail receivables. 

CFC and its subsidiaries hedge borrowings denominated in currencies other than

the borrowers' local currency with currency exchange agreements, which are

reflected in the consolidated balance sheet.   As a result, such borrowings are

translated in the financial statements at the rates of exchange established

under the related currency exchange agreements.

        Retained interests in sold receivables and other related amounts are

generally restricted and subject to limited recourse provisions.  At December

31, 1994, CFC was a party to an interest rate cap agreement related to $134

million of its retained interests.  This agreement, which is designated as a

hedge instrument, resulted in no impact on interest income at CFC.  At December

31, 1994, CFC was also a party to a forward interest rate contract (notional

amount $500 million) to manage its exposure to fluctuations in funding costs for

an anticipated securitization of retail receivables during the first quarter of

1995.

<p>

        Contractual maturities of total finance receivables as of December 31,

1994, were (in millions of dollars):  1995 - $5,219; 1996 - $1,371; 1997 -

$1,108; 1998 - $862; 1999 - $549; and 2000 and thereafter - $1,430.  Actual cash

flows will vary from contractual cash flows due to future sales of finance

receivables and prepayments.

</pre>



<p>



        (1)   The weighted average interest rates include the effects of

interest rate exchange agreements.

<p>

<p>

        At December 31, 1994, aggregate annual maturities of consolidated debt,

including principal payments on capital leases, were as follows (in millions of

dollars):  1995 - $5,456; 1996 - $1,705; 1997 - $1,009; 1998 - $999; and 1999 -

$1,577.

<p>

        CFC enters into currency exchange agreements to manage its exposure to

fluctuations in currency exchange rates related to specific funding

transactions.  Certain borrowings in U.S. Dollars, German Marks and Swiss Francs

are hedged with currency exchange agreements in the local currency of the

borrowing entity.  As a result, such borrowings are translated in the financial

statements at the rates of exchange established under the related currency

exchange agreement.  The amount of such borrowings was $734 million.  If CFC had

not entered into currency exchange agreements, the amount would have been $220

million higher at December 31, 1994.

<p>

        To mitigate risks associated with changing interest rates on certain of

its debt, CFC has entered into interest rate exchange agreements.  CFC manages

exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into such agreements only with

major financial institutions that are expected to fully perform under the terms

of such agreements.  The notional amounts are used to measure the volume of

these agreements.  The impact on interest expense of interest rate exchange

agreements was immaterial in 1994, 1993 and 1992.  Chrysler cannot predict the

impact that such agreements may have on interest expense in the future.

<p>

        Interest rate swaps related to term debt are matched with specific

obligations, altering the interest rate characteristics of the associated debt. 

Interest rate swaps are also utilized to reduce exposure to interest rate

fluctuations on the anticipated issuances of commercial paper.  Interest rate

swaps associated with commercial paper are matched with groups of such

        During 1994, CFC replaced its revolving credit and receivable sale

agreements, which were to expire in 1995, with new agreements providing for

credit lines totaling $5.2 billion and receivable sale agreements totaling $1.7

billion, expiring in 1998.  These agreements contain restrictive covenants,

which, among other things, require CFC to maintain a minimum net worth. None of

the commitments were drawn upon at December 31, 1994.

        During 1994, Chrysler replaced its $1.5 billion revolving credit

agreement, which was to expire in June 1996, with a new $1.7 billion revolving

credit agreement expiring in July 1999. The new agreement provides for reduced

interest rates and commitment fees, less restrictive financial covenants and the

removal of the lenders' ability to obtain security interests in Chrysler's

assets.  None of the commitment was drawn upon at December 31, 1994.

<h4>NOTE 7.  INCOME TAXES</h4>

<p>

        Effective January 1, 1992, Chrysler adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting

for Income Taxes,"  which resulted in a favorable cumulative effect of the

change in accounting principle of $218 million, or $0.74 per common share.

<p>

        Earnings before income taxes and the cumulative effect of changes in

accounting principles were attributable to the following sources:

        Chrysler does not provide for U.S. income tax or foreign withholding

taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as such cumulative

earnings of $1.9 billion are intended to be permanently reinvested in those

operations.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized

deferred tax liability for the undistributed foreign earnings.

        Chrysler's tax credit carryforwards expire at various dates through the

year 2009; alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration

dates.  NOL carryforwards totaled $313 million at December 31, 1994, and may be

used through the year 2008.  The valuation allowance was principally related to

certain subsidiaries' NOL carryforwards.  Changes in the valuation allowance

<h4>NOTE 8.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES</h4>



<b><h4>Litigation </h4></b>

<p>

        Various claims and legal proceedings have been asserted or instituted

against Chrysler, including some purporting to be class actions, and some which

demand large monetary damages or other relief which would require significant

expenditures. Although the ultimate cost of resolving these matters cannot be

precisely determined, Chrysler maintains reserves which it believes will be

sufficient to resolve these matters.  After giving effect to these reserves,

management believes, based on currently known facts and circumstances, that the

disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on

Chrysler's consolidated financial position.  Future developments could cause

Chrysler to change its estimate of the ultimate cost of resolving these matters,

and such changes could be material to Chrysler's consolidated results of

operations for the period in which such developments occur.  Chrysler is unable

to estimate such changes in costs, if any, which may be required in connection

with these matters.





<b><h4>Environmental Matters</h4></b>

<p>

        The United States Environmental Protection Agency and various state

agencies have notified Chrysler that it may be a potentially responsible party

("PRP") for the cost of cleaning up hazardous waste storage or disposal

facilities pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation

and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and other federal and state environmental laws.

Chrysler is also a party to a number of lawsuits filed in various jurisdictions

alleging CERCLA or other environmental claims.  In virtually all cases,

Chrysler is only one of a number of PRPs who may be found to be jointly and

severally liable.  In addition, Chrysler has identified additional active or

deactivated facilities at which it may be responsible for closure activities or

cleaning up hazardous waste.  Estimates of future costs of such environmental

matters are necessarily imprecise due to numerous uncertainties, including the

enactment of new laws and regulations, the development and application of new

technologies, the identification of new sites for which Chrysler may have

remediation responsibility and the apportionment and collectibility of

remediation costs among responsible parties. Chrysler may ultimately incur

significant expenditures over an extended period of time in connection with the

foregoing environmental matters, and therefore maintains reserves for the

estimated costs associated with all of its environmental remediation efforts,

including CERCLA and related matters, expected closure activities and voluntary

environmental cleanup efforts.  Chrysler believes that these reserves will be

sufficient to resolve these matters.  After giving effect to these reserves,

management believes, based on currently known facts and circumstances and

existing laws and regulations, that the disposition of these matters will not

have a material adverse effect on Chrysler's consolidated financial position. 

Future developments could cause Chrysler to change its estimate of the total

costs associated with these matters, and such changes could be material to

Chrysler's consolidated results of operations for the period in which such

developments occur.  Chrysler is unable to estimate such changes in costs, if

any, which may be required in connection with these matters.



<b><h4>Other Matters</h4></b>

<p>

        The majority of Chrysler's lease payments are for operating leases.  At

December 31, 1994, Chrysler had the following minimum rental commitments under

noncancelable operating leases:  1995 - $325 million; 1996 - $263 million; 1997

- $134 million; 1998 - $61 million; 1999 - $48 million; and 2000 and thereafter

- $143 million.  Future minimum lease commitments have not been reduced by

minimum sublease rentals of $252 million due in the future under noncancelable

subleases.

<p>

        Rental expense for operating leases, with original expiration dates

beyond one year, was $407 million, $410 million and $383 million in 1994, 1993

and 1992, respectively.  Sublease rentals of $60 million, $61 million, and $60

million were received in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

<p>

        Chrysler had commitments for capital expenditures, including

commitments for facilities currently under construction, approximating $1.0

billion at December 31, 1994.

<p>

        At December 31, 1994, Chrysler had guaranteed obligations of others in

the amount of $224 million, none of which were secured by collateral.

<h4>NOTE 9.  STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION</h4>

<p>

        The Chrysler Corporation 1991 Stock Compensation Plan (the "1991 Plan")

provides that Chrysler may grant stock options to officers, key employees and

nonemployee directors and also may grant reload stock options (which are

options granted when outstanding options are exercised by payment in stock),

stock appreciation rights (payable in cash or stock, at the sole discretion of

the Stock Option Committee) and limited stock appreciation rights (payable in

cash in the event of a change in control).  The 1991 Plan also provides for

awarding restricted stock units and performance stock units, which reward

service for specified periods or attainment of performance objectives.  The

Chrysler Corporation Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), initially adopted in 1972

and readopted in 1982, was amended to incorporate certain features of the 1991

Plan.



<p>

        Under the Plan and the 1991 Plan, outstanding options, consisting of

ten-year nonqualified stock options, have exercise prices of not less than the

market value of Chrysler common stock at date of grant.  Options generally

become exercisable on up to 40 percent of the shares after one year from the

date of grant, 70 percent after two years and 100 percent after three years.

Information with respect to options granted under the Plan and the 1991 Plan,

including the conversion of AMC options outstanding at the date of the AMC

acquisition, was as follows:

<p>

        Shares available for granting options at the end of 1994, 1993 and 1992

were 15.1 million, 1.5 million, and 4.4 million, respectively.  At December 31,

1994, 5.6 million options with prices ranging from $16.07 to $54.32 were not yet

exercisable under the terms of the Plan and the 1991 Plan.

<p>

        In addition to the Plan and the 1991 Plan, Chrysler has programs under

which additional compensation is paid to hourly and salaried employees based

upon various measures of Chrysler's performance.  Such performance-based

compensation programs include incentive compensation and profit sharing paid to

certain hourly and salaried employees.

<p>



        The annual dividend on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the

"Preferred Stock") is $46.25 per share.  The Preferred Stock is convertible,

unless previously redeemed, at a rate (subject to adjustment in certain events)

of 27.78 shares of common stock for each share of Preferred Stock.  The

Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to January 22, 1997.  Thereafter,

Chrysler may redeem the Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at $523.13 per

share of Preferred Stock for the period ending December 31, 1997 and thereafter

declining ratably annually to $500.00 per share after December 31, 2001, plus

accrued and unpaid dividends.



<p>

        In February 1988, the Board of Directors declared and distributed a

dividend of one Preferred Share Purchase Right (a "Right") for each then

outstanding share of Chrysler's common stock and authorized the distribution of

one Right with respect to each subsequently issued share of common stock.  Each

Right, as most recently amended, entitles a shareholder to purchase one

one-hundredth of a share of Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock of

Chrysler at a price of $120.  The Rights are attached to the common stock and

are not represented by separate certificates or exercisable until the earliest

to occur of (i) 10 days following the time (the "Stock Acquisition Time") of a

public announcement or communication to Chrysler that a person or group of

persons has acquired or obtained the right to acquire 15 percent or more of

Chrysler's outstanding common stock, and (ii) 10 business days after a person

or group announces or commences a tender offer that would result, if

successful, in the bidder owning 15 percent or more of Chrysler's outstanding

common stock. If the acquiring person or group acquires 15 percent or more of

the common stock (except pursuant to a tender offer made for all of Chrysler's

common stock, and determined by Chrysler's independent directors to be fair and

in the best interests of Chrysler and its shareholders) each Right (other than

those held by the acquiror) will entitle its holder to buy, for $120, a number

of shares of Chrysler's common stock having a market value of $240.  Similarly,

if after the Stock Acquisition Time, Chrysler is acquired in a merger or other

business combination and is not the surviving corporation, or 50 percent or

more of its assets, cash flow or earning power is sold, each Right (other than

those held by the surviving or acquiring company) will entitle its holder to

purchase, for $120, shares of the surviving or acquiring company having a

market value of $240.  Chrysler's directors may redeem the Rights at $0.05 per

Right, and may amend the Rights or extend the time during which the Rights may

be redeemed, only prior to the Stock Acquisition Time. Additionally, at any

time after a person acquires 15 percent or more, but less than 50 percent, of

Chrysler's common stock, Chrysler's directors may exchange the Rights (other

than those held by the acquiror), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of

one share of common stock (or a fractional share of preferred stock with

equivalent voting rights) per Right. The Rights will expire on February 22,

1998.

<p>

        Of the 1.0 billion shares of authorized common stock at December 31,

1994, 97 million shares were reserved for issuance under Chrysler's various

employee benefit plans and the conversion of the Preferred Stock.

<p>

        Primary earnings (loss) per-common-share amounts were computed by

dividing earnings (loss) after deduction of preferred stock dividends by the

average number of common and dilutive equivalent shares outstanding.  Fully

diluted per-common-share amounts assume conversion of the Preferred Stock, the

elimination of the related preferred stock dividend requirement, and the

issuance of common stock for all other potentially dilutive equivalents

outstanding.  Fully diluted per-common-share amounts are not applicable for

loss periods.

<h4>NOTE 11.  PENSION PLANS</h4>

<p>

        Chrysler's pension plans provide noncontributory and contributory

benefits.  The noncontributory pension plans cover substantially all of the

hourly and salaried employees of Chrysler and certain of its consolidated

subsidiaries.  Benefits are based on a fixed rate for each year of service. 

Additionally, contributory benefits and supplemental noncontributory benefits

are provided to substantially all salaried employees of Chrysler and certain of

its consolidated subsidiaries under the Salaried Employees' Retirement Plan. 

This plan provides contributory benefits based on the employee's cumulative

contributions and a supplemental noncontributory benefit based on years of

service during which employee contributions were made, and the employee's

average salary during the consecutive five years in which salary was highest in

the 15 years preceding retirement.

<p>

        Contributions to the pension trust fund for U.S. plans are in

compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as

amended.  All pension trust fund assets and income accruing thereon are used

solely to pay pension benefits and administer the plans.  Chrysler made pension

fund contributions totaling $2.6 billion in 1994, $3.5 billion in 1993 and $816

million in 1992.

<p>

        At December 31, 1994, plan assets were invested in a diversified

portfolio that consisted primarily of debt and equity securities, including

17.9 million shares of Chrysler common stock with a market value of $879

million.  During 1994, $17 million of dividends were received on Chrysler

common stock.

The components of pension expense were as follows:

        During 1994, 1993 and 1992, the cost of voluntary early retirement

programs, which are periodically offered to certain salaried and hourly

employees, was $68 million, $40 million and $48 million, respectively.

<p>

        Pension expense is determined using assumptions at the beginning of the

year.  The projected benefit obligation ("PBO") is determined using the

assumptions at the end of the year. Assumptions used to determine pension

expense and the PBO were:

        The increase in the discount rate for U.S. Plans from 7.38 percent as of

December 31, 1993 to 8.63 percent as of December 31, 1994 resulted in a $1.3

billion decrease in the PBO at December 31, 1994 and is expected to result in a

$99 million decrease in the 1995 expense.

<h4>NOTE 13.  SALES OF AUTOMOTIVE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS</h4>

<p>

        During 1994, Chrysler sold its wire harness operations and certain of

its soft trim operations, and entered into five-year supply agreements with

each of the purchasers.  Aggregate net proceeds from the sales and the supply

agreements were approximately $325 million.  The related pretax gains of

approximately $250 million were deferred and are being recognized over the

periods of the respective supply agreements.

<p>

        In 1993, Chrysler sold its plastics operations for net proceeds of $132

million.  The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $60 million ($39 million after

applicable income taxes).  Also during 1993, Chrysler sold its remaining 50.3

million shares of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation ("MMC") stock for net proceeds

of $329 million, resulting in a pretax gain of $205 million ($128 million after

applicable income taxes).

<p>

        In 1992, Chrysler sold 43.6 million shares of MMC stock for net

proceeds of $215 million, resulting in a pretax gain of $142 million ($88

million after applicable income taxes).

<h4>NOTE 16.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</h4>

<p>

        The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined

by Chrysler using available market information and the valuation methodologies

described below.  However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting

market data to develop the estimates of fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates

presented herein may not be indicative of the amounts that Chrysler could

realize in a current market exchange.  The use of different assumptions or

valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value

amounts.

<p>

        The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable

and accounts payable approximated fair values due to the short-term maturities

of these instruments.

<p>

        The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of other

financial instruments are summarized as follows:



<h5>Marketable securities</h5>

<p>

        The fair values of marketable securities were estimated using quoted

market prices.



<h5>Finance receivables, retained interests in sold receivables and

other related amounts - net

</h5>

<p>

        The carrying value of variable-rate finance receivables was assumed to

approximate fair value since they are priced at current market rates.  The fair

value of fixed-rate finance receivables was estimated by discounting expected

cash flows using rates at which loans of similar maturity would be made as of

the date of the consolidated balance sheet.  The fair values of excess servicing

cash flows and other amounts due CFC arising from receivable sale transactions

were estimated by discounting expected cash flows.





<h5>Debt</h5>

<p>

        The fair value of public debt was estimated using quoted market prices. 

The fair value of other long-term debt was estimated by discounting future cash

flows using rates currently available for debt with similar terms and remaining

maturities.



<h5>Currency exchange agreements</h5>

<p>

        The fair values of currency exchange agreements were estimated by

discounting the expected cash flows using market exchange rates and relative

market interest rates over the remaining terms of the agreements.  Currency

exchange agreements are more fully described in <b>Note 1. Summary of Significant

Accounting Policies</b> and <b>Note 6. Debt.</b>



<h5>Interest rate exchange agreements</h5>

<p>

        The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward

interest rate contracts were estimated by discounting expected cash flows using

quoted market interest rates.  Interest rate exchange agreements are more fully

described in <b>Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 3. 

Finance Receivables, Retained Interests in Sold Receivables and Other Related

Amounts</b> and <b>Note 6. Debt.</b>



<h5>Currency forward contracts and purchased currency options</h5>

<p>

        The fair values of currency forward contracts and purchased currency

options were estimated based on quoted market prices for contracts of similar

terms.  Currency forward contracts and purchased currency options are more

fully described in <b>Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.</b>



<p>

        Although not a counterparty to certain derivative financial instruments

entered into between securitization trusts and third parties, CFC receives an

indirect beneficial interest from such instruments.  Such indirect beneficial

interests are subject to reduction in the event of a counterparty's

nonperformance.  If a counterparty had failed to perform at December 31, 1994,

CFC would have been exposed to a $27 million loss. 

<p>

        The fair value estimates presented herein were based on information

available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet.  Although

management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the

estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been revalued since the

date of the consolidated balance sheet and, therefore, current estimates of

fair value may differ from the amounts presented herein.

        Interest expense of the Financial Services segment has been netted

against operating earnings, which is consistent with industry practice. The

individual segments do not add to the consolidated amounts due to the

<h3>Management Report on Responsibility for Financial Reporting</h3></center>

<p>

Chrysler's management is responsible for preparing the financial        

statements and other financial information in this Annual Report. This

responsibility includes maintaining the integrity and objectivity of financial

data and the presentation of Chrysler's results of operations and financial

position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The

financial statements include amounts that are based on management's best

estimates and judgments.

<p>

Chrysler's financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP,

independent auditors.  Their audits were conducted in accordance with generally

accepted auditing standards and included consideration of the internal control

system and tests of transactions as part of planning and performing their

audits.

<p>

Chrysler maintains a system of internal controls that provides  reasonable

assurance that its records reflect its transactions in all material respects

and that significant misuse or loss of assets will be prevented.  Management

believes the system of internal controls is adequate to accomplish these

objectives on a continuous basis.  Chrysler maintains a strong internal

auditing program that independently assesses the effectiveness of the internal

controls and recommends possible improvements. Management considers the

recommendations of the General Auditor and Deloitte & Touche LLP concerning the

system of internal controls and takes appropriate actions to respond to these

recommendations.

<p>

The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee composed solely

of nonemployee directors, is responsible for determining that management

fulfills its responsibilities in the preparation of financial statements and

the maintenance of internal controls.  In fulfilling its responsibility, the

Audit Committee recommends independent auditors to the Board of Directors for

appointment by the shareholders.  The Committee also reviews the consolidated

financial statements and adequacy of internal controls.  The Audit Committee

meets regularly with management, the General Auditor and the independent

auditors. Both the independent auditors and the General Auditor have full and

free access to the Audit Committee, without management representatives present,

to discuss the scope and results of their audits and their views on the

adequacy of internal controls and the quality of financial reporting.

<p>

It is the business philosophy of Chrysler Corporation and its subsidiaries to

obey the law and to require that its employees conduct their activities

according to the highest standards of business ethics.  Management reinforces

this philosophy by numerous actions, including issuing a Code of Ethical

Behavior and maintaining a Business Practices Committee and a Business

Practices Office to support compliance with the Corporation's policies.

<h4>Independent Auditors' Report</h4>



<p>

Shareholders and Board of Directors<br>

Chrysler Corporation<br>

Highland Park, Michigan<br>

<p>

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler

Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,

and the related consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for each of

the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994.  These financial

statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our

responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on

our audits.

<p>

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing

standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain

reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of

material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence

supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit

also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates

made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement

presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our

opinion.

<p>

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all

material respects, the financial position of Chrysler Corporation and

consolidated subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of

their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period

ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting

principles.

<p>

As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, the Company adopted new

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards and, accordingly, changed its

method of accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities in

1994, its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than

pensions and postemployment benefits in 1993, and its method of accounting

for income taxes in 1992.

(1)  Results for the first quarter of 1993 included the unfavorable effects of

     changes in accounting principles of $4.68 billion related to the adoption

     of SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other  

     Than Pensions," and $283 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 112,

     "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."

<p>

(2)  Earnings for the second quarter of 1993 included a gain of $60 million 

     ($39 million after applicable income taxes) related to the sale of

     Chrysler's plastics operations and a gain of $111 million ($70 million

     after applicable income taxes) related to the sale of 27 million shares of 

     Mitsubishi Motors Corporation ("MMC") stock.

<p>

(3)  Earnings for the third quarter of 1993 included a gain of $94 million 

     ($58 million after applicable income taxes) related to the sale of 

     Chrysler's remaining 23.3 million shares of MMC stock.

<p>

(4)  Earnings for the fourth quarter of 1994 included favorable adjustments to

     the provision for income taxes aggregating $132 million. These adjustments

     related to:  (1) the recognition of tax credits related to expenditures in

     prior years for qualifying research and development activities, in 

     accordance with an Internal Revenue Service settlement which was based on

     recently issued U.S. Department of Treasury income tax regulations, and

     (2) the reversal of valuation allowances related to tax benefits

     associated with net operating loss carry forwards.

This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental Operations on

an Equity Basis)," reflects the results of operations of Chrysler with its

investments in Chrysler Financial Corporation ("CFC") and its investments in

short-term vehicle rental subsidiaries (the "Car Rental Operations") accounted

for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries.  This Supplemental Information does not purport to present results of operations in

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because it does not

comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 94,

"Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries."  The financial covenant

contained in Chrysler's revolving credit facility is based on this Supplemental

Information.  In addition, because the operations of CFC and the Car Rental

Operations are different in nature than Chrysler's manufacturing operations,

management believes that this disaggregated financial data enhances an

understanding of the consolidated financial statements.

This Supplemental Information, "Chrysler (with CFC and Car Rental Operations on

an Equity Basis)," reflects the financial position of Chrysler with its

investments in CFC and the Car Rental Operations accounted for on an equity

basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries.  This Supplemental Information

does not purport to present financial position in accordance with generally

accepted accounting principles because it does not comply with SFAS No. 94,

"Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries."  The financial covenant

contained in Chrysler's revolving credit facility is based on this Supplemental

Information.  In addition, because the operations of CFC and the Car Rental

Operations are different in nature than Chrysler's manufacturing operations,

management believes that this disaggregated financial data enhances an

understanding of the consolidated financial statements.
